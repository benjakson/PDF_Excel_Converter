These Specifications are intended  for  the  design  of  tunnels  constructed  using  cut-and- tunnel  cover,  bored,  mined,  construction methodologies.   these  not  Specifications for water conveyance, utility, transit, or  rail  tunnels  or  for  shafts.  For  tunnel  elements  not  explicitly  covered  herein,  the  provisions  of  these  Specifications  may  be  applied,  as  augmented  by  the  Engineer  with  additional  design  criteria  where  required.   Provisions   immersed   included   are   in   Construction specifications consistent with these  design  Specifications  are  not  included.  There  is  a  listing  of  specification  suggested  construction  sections included in Appendix B.   tunnels   internal   Structures   that  support  to  roadways  over  ventilation  plenums,  roadways,  or  other  openings  in  the  tunnel  shall  be  designed  in  accordance  with  the  AASHTO  LRFD  Bridge  Design  Specifications  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  LRFD  interim  Specifications)  changes and as modified or supplemented herein. The  load  effects  of  these  internal  structures  shall  be  applied to the tunnel lining, walls, or other supporting  members in accordance with these Specifications.   including  all  applicable   Retaining  walls  for  retained  cut  approaches  to  tunnels  shall  be  designed  in  accordance  with  the  LRFD Specifications.   Support  and  ancillary  structures  such  as  ventilation,  control,  and  administrative buildings  are  not covered by these Specifications. These structures  shall  be  designed  in  accordance  with  local  building  codes.   the  Engineer  may  require   These Specifications are not intended to supplant  proper  training  and  experience  or  the  exercise  of  judgment  by  the  Engineer,  and  provide  only  the  minimum  requirements  necessary  for  public  safety.  the  The  Owner  or  sophistication of design or the quality of materials and  the  minimum  construction  requirements.  The  design  of  tunnels  is  strongly  dependent upon the geologic setting, site conditions,  and  construction  methodology,  and  this  fact  is  considered  in  the  Specifications.  The  concept  of  ground/structure interaction is emphasized for mined  and  bored  tunnels;  however,  it  is  also  applicable  to  cut-and-cover and immersed tunnels.    to  be  higher   than   The  concept  of  safety  through  redundancy  and  ductility is emphasized for tunnel elements subject to  repeated loads and load reversals.   The  design  provisions  of  these  Specifications  employ  the  Load  and  Resistance  Factor  Design  (LRFD)  methodology.  The  load  factors  have  been  calibrated  using  structural  analysis  modeling  for  a  limited  number  of  loading  conditions  that  take  into  account ground/structure interaction.    These Specifications are modeled after the LRFD  Specifications and the AASHTO Guide Specifications  for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design. The philosophy and  guidance  provided  in  those  documents  are  carried  forward and implemented in this document.   Whenever   the  LRFD  Specifications   are  referenced  in  this  document,  the  reference  is  to  the  latest edition including all applicable interim changes.  The  term  “notional”  is  often  used  in  these  Specifications to indicate an idealization of a physical  phenomenon,  as  in  “notional  load”  or  “notional  resistance.”  Use  of  the  this  separation of an engineer’s “notion” or perception of  the  physical  world  in  the  context  of  design  from  physical reality itself.    term  strengthens   The  term  “shall”  denotes  a  requirement  for   compliance with these Specifications.    The term “should” indicates a strong preference   for a given criterion.   The  term  “may”  indicates  a  criterion  that  is  usable,  but  other  local  and  suitably  documented,  verified, and approved criteria may also be used in a  manner consistent with the LRFD approach to tunnel  design.   The load factors specified in Section 3 have been  to  provide  designs  with  member  calibrated  proportions  consistent  with  the  current  practice  in  tunnel design.    The calibration is based upon analyses performed  for a circular bored tunnel. Additional calibration for  tunnel  cross-sectional  geometry  and  different  loadings  from  a  variety  of  ground  conditions  would  be  useful  in  further  validating  and  refining  the  load  factors.    The  primary  loads  on  structural  components  of  tunnels  are  groundwater  and  earth  loads.  For  immersed  tunnels,  loads  imposed  by  transporting  immersed  elements  from  the  fabrication  site  to  the  tunnel  location  can  also  govern  the  design  of  these  tunnels.  For  pre-fabricated  linings  used  in  bored  tunnels, construction-imposed loading can govern the  design.  The  determination  of  groundwater,  earth,  transportation,  and  other  construction  loads  varies  based on the in-situ conditions, level of testing during  subsurface investigations, and ground conditions may  have great variation. There are little data available to  establish  a  statistically  significant  sampling in order  to calibrate these Specifications based upon structural  reliability  theory.  As  such,  judgment  and  past  experience were also used to select the load factors.   These  Specifications  are  an  initial  attempt  to  codify  and  standardize  highway  tunnel  design.  As  such, as future data that are produced in a systematic  fashion  in  accordance  with  these  Specifications  become available, recalibration may be implemented  based on statistical evaluation of these data.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Force Effect—A deformation, stress, or stress resultant (i.e., axial force, shear force, torsional or flexural moment)  caused by applied loads, imposed deformations, temperature changes, or volumetric changes.   Immersed Tunnel—A tunnel constructed from prefabricated elements constructed off the tunnel alignment, floated  into place over the tunnel alignment, and placed into a prepared trench. Placement is facilitated by the addition of  ballast  to  the  elements  to  cause  them  to be immersed  to  the pre-determined depth and  then joined  to  the  adjacent  element(s) already in place.   Limit State—A condition beyond which the tunnel or component ceases to satisfy the provisions for which it was  designed.   Load Modifier—A factor accounting for ductility, redundancy, and the operational classification of the tunnel.

Regular Service—Condition excluding the presence of special permit vehicles and extreme events.   Rehabilitation—A  process  in  which  the  resistance  or  functionality  of  a  tunnel  component  or  connection  is  either  restored or increased.   Resistance Factor—A statistically or experience-based multiplier applied to nominal resistance accounting primarily  for  variability  of  material  properties,  structural  dimensions,  and  workmanship,  an  uncertainty  in  the  prediction  of  resistance, but also related to the statistics of the loads through the calibration process.   Service Life—The period of time that the tunnel is expected to be in operation.   Tunnel—Road  tunnels  as  defined  by  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  (AASHTO) Technical Committee for Tunnels (T-20) are enclosed roadways with vehicle access that is restricted to  portals regardless of type of the structure or method of construction. The committee further defines road tunnels not  to include enclosed roadway created by highway bridges, railroad bridges, or other bridges. This definition applies to  all types of tunnel structures and tunneling methods such as cut-and-cover tunnels, mined and bored tunnels in rock  and soft ground, and immersed tunnels.   Tunnel  Boring  Machine  (TBM)—Machine  that  excavates  a  tunnel  by  drilling  out  the  heading  to  full  size  in  one  operation. Sometimes called a mole, the TBM is typically propelled forward by jacking off the excavation supports  emplaced behind it or by gripping the side of the excavation (AASHTO, 2010).   1.3—DESIGN PHILOSOPHY   1.3.1—General   C1.3.1   Tunnels shall be designed for specified limit states  to achieve the objectives of constructability, safety, and  serviceability, with due regard to issues of inspectability,  maintenance  and  economy.  Additional  information  regarding tunnel systems, planning, ancillary facilities,  and  appurtenances  can  be  found  in  Section  2.  Regardless  of  the  type  of  analysis  used,  Equation  1.3.2.1-1 shall be satisfied for all specified force effects  and combinations thereof.    The  limit  states  specified  herein  are  intended  to  provide  for  a  buildable,  serviceable  tunnel  capable  of  safely operating for a specified design life. As defined  in Article 1.2, the design life relates to the return period  of  the  transient  loads  of  the  strength  limit  states  and  hence their nominal magnitude. The design life should  not  be  confused  with  the  service  life.  As  defined  in  Article  1.2,  the  service  life  relates  to  the  eventual  demonstrated durability of the tunnel.

The  resistance  of  components  and  connections  is  determined,  in  many  cases,  on  the  basis  of  inelastic  behavior.  In  other  words,  the  capacity  of  tunnel  components  used  to  define  their  nominal  resistance  at  the strength limit states is based upon behavior past first  yield of the material. On the other hand, the force effects  on the load side of the LRFD equation, Equation 1.3.2.1- 1, are determined using elastic analysis but amplified by  the specified load factors. This apparent inconsistency  is consistent with most modern structural-design codes  including the LRFD Specifications. The application of  this comparison of loads and resistances for design is a  result  of  incomplete  knowledge  of  inelastic  structural  action  combined  with  the  behavior  of  the  earth  surrounding  the  tunnel  that  acts  in  concert  with  the  tunnel structure.   C1.3.2.1   Equation  1.3.2.1-1  is  the  basis  of  the  LRFD   methodology.  Ductility,   and   redundancy,   operational  classification  are  considered  in  the  load  modifier  η.  Whereas the ductility and redundancy directly relate to  physical  strength,  operational  classification  concerns  the consequences of the tunnel being out of service. The  grouping of these aspects of the load side of Equation  1.3.2.1-1 is therefore, arbitrary. However, it constitutes  a  first  effort  at  codification.  In  the  absence  of  more  precise  information,  each  effect  is  estimated  as  ±5  percent, accumulated geometrically, a clearly subjective  approach.    Groundwater is an example of a loading that would  be appropriate to apply as a maximum and a minimum.  Variation in groundwater elevations are common due to  seasonal  changes  and  tidal  influences.  Tunnel  linings  are  designed  as  compression  members;  therefore,  maximum  groundwater  pressures  would  produce  maximum  axial  loads  and  vice  versa.  As  such,  both  maximum and  minimum groundwater loads should be  checked.   The specified 150-year design life is appropriate for  the  design  of  tunnel  geotechnical  features  and  soil– structure-interaction-systems  given  the  high  capital  costs  of  rehabilitation  and  replacement  and  the  likely  importance  to  the  transportation  network.  Internal  structures such as roadway slabs and suspended ceilings  as well as system components, such as signs, piping, and  their supports; communication and signal devices; and  ventilation equipment that are more easily replaced, may  have design lives assigned to them by the Owner.   1.3.2—Limit States   1.3.2.1—General   Each  component  and  connection  shall  satisfy  Equation 1.3.2.1-1, for each limit state unless otherwise  specified. For service and extreme limit states, resistance  factors shall be taken as 1.0 except for bolts. For bolts,  the  provisions  of  Article  6.5.5  of  the  LRFD  Specifications shall apply.

The service limit state provides certain experience- related provisions that cannot always be derived solely  from strength or statistical consideration.   For  tunnels,  this  limit  state  controls  tunnel  lining   deformation, cracking, and leaking.   1.3.2.3—Fatigue and Fracture Limit State   C1.3.2.3   The fatigue and fracture limit state shall be taken as  restrictions  on  stress  range  as  a  result  of  repetitive  machinery or ventilation loads at the number of expected  stress range cycles.   The  fatigue  and  fracture  limit  state  is  intended  to  limit  crack  growth  under  repetitive  loads  to  prevent  fracture  during  the  design  life  of  the  component.  Additionally,  the  fatigue  limit  state  is  intended  to  prevent premature failure of anchoring and supporting  components subject to machinery or ventilation loads.   1.3.2.4—Strength Limit State    C1.3.2.4   Strength  limit  state  shall  be  taken  to  ensure  that  strength and stability, both local and global, are provided  to  resist  the  specified  statistically  significant  load  combinations that a tunnel and its component parts are  expected to experience in its design life.   The  strength  limit  state  considers  stability  or  yielding of each structural element. If the resistance of  any  element,  including  splices  and  connections,  is  exceeded,  it  is  assumed  that  the  tunnel  resistance  has  been  exceeded.  The  redistribution  of  loads  that  can  occur  due  to  structure–ground  interaction  typically  allows the tunnel ground supporting structure to support  loads in excess of the capacity calculated utilizing linear  elastic static analysis. Extensive distress and structural  damage  may  occur  under  the  strength  limit  state,  but  overall structural integrity is expected to be maintained.   1.3.2.5—Extreme Event Limit State   C1.3.2.5   The  extreme  event  limit  state  shall  be  taken  to  ensure the structural survival of a tunnel during a major  earthquake,  flood,  tsunami,  collision, blast, or fire,  or  when an immersed tunnel is subject to sinking vessel or  anchor  drag  loads  possibly  during,  or  in  conjunction  with, a scour event.   1.3.3—Ductility   The  structural  system  of  a   tunnel  shall  be  proportioned and detailed to ensure the development of   Extreme  event  limit  states  are  considered  to  be  unique  occurrences  whose  return  period  may  be  significantly greater than the design life of the tunnel.

Brittle  behavior is undesirable because it implies a sudden loss  of load-carrying capacity immediately when the elastic  limit  is  reached.  Ductile  behavior  is  characterized  by  significant inelastic deformations before any loss of load  carrying  capacity  occurs.  The  redistribution  of  load  effects provided by ground–structure interaction results  in  ductile  behavior  of  concrete  tunnel  linings  when  proper  detailing  of  the  reinforcing  is  used.  Internal  components,  however,  should  be  designed  to  exhibit  the  LRFD  ductile  behavior.

The  shape  of  the  excavation  is  customized  to  the  ground  conditions and geometric functional requirements of the  tunnel.  The  excavated  ground  typically  requires  initial  support prior  to  the  construction of  a  permanent lining.   Mined  tunnels  in  competent  rock  may  also  be  unlined.  Detailed design requirements for this type of tunnel are  provided in Section 7.   Jacked  box  tunnels  are  included  in  the  category  of  mined tunnels. Jacked box tunnels are prefabricated box  structures jacked horizontally through the ground using  methods to reduce the friction between the ground and  the  box.  Jacked  box  tunnels  often  are  used  where  the  tunnel  is  required  to  be  very  shallow  and  it  is  not  possible  to  disturb  the  surface,  for  example  beneath  active  railway  runways  at  airports  or  under  embankments.   Mined tunnels include those constructed utilizing the   sequential excavation method.    Mined tunnels may be constructed in free air or under   2.4.3—Bored Tunnels   compressed air.   C2.4.3   Bored  tunnels  are  defined  as  those  constructed  through the use of specialized equipment known as tunnel  boring machines (TBMs) without disturbing the ground  surface. The excavation process may be performed in free  air or may require a pressurized face depending on ground  and  groundwater  conditions.  A  bored  tunnel  may  be  unlined  or  lined.  Detailed  design  requirements  for  this  type of tunnel are provided in Section 7.   The TBM consists of a shield to temporarily support  the ground, a cutter head for excavating the ground and  removing the muck, and supporting equipment.    TBMs  utilized  for  rock  tunneling  may  include  gripper  pads  to  provide  forward  thrust  for  the  TBM.  TBMs  for  soft  ground  and  some  rock  tunnels  may  include an array of jacks to provide forward thrust for  the TBM.   2.4.4—Immersed Tunnels   C2.4.4   Immersed tunnels are defined as those constructed by  immersing a prefabricated element into a prepared trench  excavated  from  the  bottom  of  a  waterway.  Immersed  tunnels  are  a  specialized  type  of  cut-and-cover  tunnel.  Pre-fabricated tunnel elements are constructed of precast- concrete or a combination of structural steel and concrete,  sealed with bulkheads at each end, and floated from the  fabrication yard to the construction site. The elements are  located over the excavated trench and lowered into place  by  adding  ballast.  Once  in  place,  the  elements  are    Although immersed tunnels are a subset of cut-and- cover  tunnels,  the  portion  of  the  tunnel  that  is  submerged under water is referred to as the immersed  tunnel.  The  tunnel  alignment  must  transition  on  land  from  the  depth  where  the  tunnel  element  can  be  submerged  to  the  depth  where  a  retained  cut  can  be  constructed. This transition is constructed utilizing cut- and-cover technology as described in Article 2.4.1. This  transition is referred to as the cut-and-cover portion of  the tunnel.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  All rights reserved.

Detailed  design requirements for this type of tunnel are provided  in Section 8.   Immersed tunnel elements must be designed to resist  the  load  effects  associated  with  floating  at  the  fabrication  site  and  transportation  to  the  construction  site.   2.4.5—Shafts   C2.4.5   Shafts  are  defined  as  vertical  or  steeply  inclined  excavations that connect the tunnel to the ground surface,  and are located between the tunnel portals. Shafts may be  excavated from the surface or from underground back to  the surface. Shafts are not addressed in this specification.   2.5—PLANNING AND ROUTE  CONSIDERATIONS   Shafts are typically used for emergency egress and   ventilation when required by the length of the tunnel.   2.5.1—General   C2.5.1   The selection of the type of tunnel shall be based on  the  geometrical  configurations,  ground  conditions,  type  of crossing, and environmental requirements.    surface   including   There  are  multiple  components   to  vehicular  transportation  systems,  roads,  bridges, viaducts, and tunnels. The selection of a road  tunnel over other components for a project (or a portion  of a project) is typically determined prior to the design  phase. Road tunnels are often selected to shorten travel  times and distance, avoid surface traffic congestion or  surface disturbance, or to cross physical barriers such as  mountains, rivers, or other water bodies.   The choice for location of tunnels shall be supported  by analyses of alternatives, which is typically completed  during the planning and National Environmental Policy  Act  (NEPA)  phase  of  tunnel  projects.  The  Preferred  Alternative  is  typically  identified  in  the  final  NEPA  decision  document  (e.g.,  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement (FEIS)/Record of Decision (ROD), Finding of  No  Significant  Impact  (FONSI))  as  the  final  approved  location for the alignment.   Tunnel planning is typically subject to  NEPA, 42  U.S.C.  4321–4347,  since  most  tunnel  projects  likely  involve federal funding or federal approval, triggering  NEPA. For roadway tunnels involving federal funding,  the following NEPA regulations are applicable:    \\uf0b7   \\uf0b7   40 CFR Part 1500-1508, CEQ Regulations for  Implementing NEPA  23 CFR 771, FHWA, Environmental Impacts  and Related Procedures   location  for   the  final  approved   NEPA requires the evaluation of alternatives during  the  planning  phase,  and  a  Preferred  Alternative  is  selected  at  the  conclusion  of  the  NEPA  process.  The  Preferred  Alternative  is  identified  in  the  final  NEPA  (e.g.,  FEIS/ROD,  FONSI),  decision  document  identifying  the  alignment.  The  NEPA  document  outlines  the  purpose  and  need  that  the  proposed  project  is  intended  to  address, including an evaluation of the effectiveness of  the  Preferred  Alternative  in  meeting  the  identified  purpose  and  need  for  the  project.

Most road tunnels require some form of ventilation  to mitigate the accumulation of vehicle emissions, and  to manage the flow of heat and smoke resulting from a  vehicle fire occurring inside the tunnel. Depending on  factors  such  as  tunnel  length,  tunnel  geometry,  traffic  mix, and traffic volumes, certain tunnels may be capable  of self-ventilating while others require the assistance of  mechanical ventilation systems. Self-ventilating tunnels  rely solely on the movement of traffic to provide enough  air flow through the tunnel to dilute vehicle emissions  and  disperse  them,  typically,  through  the  exit  portal.  Mechanical  ventilation  systems  in  road  tunnels  are  typically  designed  to  assist  the  movement  of  air  longitudinally  through  the  tunnel;  either  for  the  full  length  of  the  tunnel  or  to  a  location  within  the  tunnel  where the vitiated air (or smoke and heat resulting from  a fire emergency) can be safely extracted. Mechanical  ventilation  systems  commonly  used  in  road  tunnels  include  transverse  and  semi-transverse  supply  and  exhaust systems, point extraction (exhaust) systems, jet  fan  based  longitudinal  systems,  and  injection  fan   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Tunnel drainage systems can be the recipients of a  variety  of  liquids,  including  water,  washing  and  firefighting  chemicals,  motor  vehicle  fuels,  and  lubricants and liquid cargo of all types.   Tunnel  operational  practices  and  restrictions  on  cargo permitted to be transported through the tunnel can  assist  in  limiting  the  types  of  liquids  required  to  be  conveyed and handled by the tunnel drainage system.    The  purpose  of  intercepting  storm  water  at  the  tunnel  portals  is  to  avoid  the  need  for  a  significantly  larger  pump  station  and  equipment  to  handle  typical  storm flow conditions.   Wash  water  loads  typically  vary  from  150  to  500  gallons  per  minute.  Firefighting  loads  are  determined  based  on  the  fire  suppression  system  design  flow.  Tunnel seepage requirements are determined based on  the  preference  of  the  Owner.  Typical  values  are  generally  less  than  one  gallon/minute/1,000  feet  of  tunnel.   Other  areas  requiring  drainage  considerations  include  ventilation  ducts  and  safety  or  maintenance  walks.  It  is  also  recommended  that  any  electrical  raceways, pull-boxes, and hand holes be provided with  drainage  systems  that  connect  to  the  tunnel  drainage  system.

The  design  shall  also consider the maintenance procedures to be used for  cleaning  these  surfaces  and  how  that  will  affect  the  maintained lighting values in the tunnel.   The  nighttime  luminance  level  shall  be  uniform  through  the  entire  length  of  the  tunnel  and  provide  an   The  objective  is  to  utilize  the  most  beneficial  luminance  level  to  ensure  driver  visibility  while  controlling initial cost.   An  equivalent  veiling  luminance  (Lseq)  analysis  determines the adaptation of the eye of an approaching  motorist  for  that  specific  day/time/condition.  After  determining the adaptation of the driver, formulas can  then  be  applied  to  determine  how  much  lighting  is  needed  inside  the  tunnel  in  order  see  a  hazard  on  the  road  from  outside  the  tunnel  at  a  safe  sight  stopping  distance  (SSSD).  Once  inside  the  tunnel,  transition  zones  are  used  to  reduce  the  lighting  levels  at  a  rate  which maintains the vision of the driver.   ANSI/IES  RP-22  divides  the  tunnel  into  separate  zones  to  accommodate  the  proper  adaptation  of  the  human  eye.  These  zones  are  called  ‘approach,’  ‘threshold,’  ‘transition,’  and  ‘interior.’  The  length  of  each zone and the lighting requirements for each zone  correlate  to  the  curve  of  eye  adaptation.  This  curve  relates speed to visibility by transforming the rate of eye  adaptation  to  SSSD  established  by  AASHTO.  The  current  standards  suggest  that  one  SSSD  for  the  threshold,  followed  by  a  10-second  transition  will  provide enough time for a driver to adapt to the tunnel’s  interior environment.   Lighting  design  for  tunnels  is  luminance  based  design for the roadway. Typical pavements used in the  US  include  R1  which  is  a  concrete  pavement  and  R3  which  is  asphalt.  Pavement  types  are  defined  in  ANSI/IES RP-8.   Other criteria are given for the walls of the tunnel,  and conversions are included in RP-22 in order to use  illuminance levels for the wall surfaces.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The  interior  zone  illumination  levels  shall  be  extended to the exit portal. An exception to this would be  bi-directional tunnels or tunnels that may be used as bi- directional under certain operating conditions. For these  cases, a threshold lighting analysis shall be required.   In  order   to  allow  for  visual  accommodation  approaching and exiting the tunnel, the entrance approach  and exit approach lighting shall be no less than one-third  of  the  nighttime  tunnel  luminance  in  order  to  maintain  good visibility.   There  is  general  agreement  by  authorities  that  the  eye’s natural ability to quickly adjust to an increasing  level of illumination precludes the need for providing a  higher light level at the exit portal.   2.8.5.1.2—Design Parameters   C2.8.5.1.2   The design parameters that influence the selection of  the  lighting  design  are:    LLF,  luminaire  efficiency  and  distribution,  reflectance  of  the  interior  surfaces,  and  tunnel geometry. LLF is calculated as follows:   LLF = (LAT) × (VF) × (RSDD) × BO × (LLD) ×    (LDD)   where:   (2.7.5.1.2-1)   Light loss factors are adjustments that are made in  order  to  adjust  the  lighting  calculations  to  anticipated  field  conditions.  This  overall  adjustment  is  dependent  on a series of recoverable and non-recoverable factors  which will affect the lighting system’s operation from  the time the system is first turned on, through the life of  the  system.  Refer  to  ANSI/IES  RP-22  for  additional  information  and  guidance  in  determining  appropriate  values for Equation 2.7.5.1.2-1.   LAT  =  Luminaire ambient temperature factor  VF  =  Voltage factor   RSSD   =  Room surface dirt depreciation factor  BO    =  Burn out factor   LLD   =  Lamp lumen depreciation factor  LDD   =  Luminaire dirt depreciation factor   Determination of the proper dirt depreciation factor  should  be  through  discussions  with  maintenance  personnel and expected environmental conditions of dirt,  road spray, and vehicle exhaust.   The single largest light loss factor in tunnels is dirt  depreciation. Depending on the operating environment  and cleaning cycles used, dirt can reduce the output of  the luminaires by over 50 percent.   2.8.5.1.3—Lighting Control System   C2.8.5.1.3   The tunnel lighting control system shall be designed  to  operate  automatically  and  maintain  a  predetermined  ratio  of  outdoor  luminance  to  threshold  and  transition  zone  luminance  for  each  roadway,  under  all  weather  conditions, during daytime operating hours. The system  shall prohibit response to sudden and short duration (less  than  15  minutes)  light  level  changes  and  shall  respond  only to steady and long duration (more than 15 minutes)  changes.   The  controller  shall  also  consider  the  ability  to  monitor  multiple  luminance  sensors  located  throughout  the  tunnel,  to  monitor  the  maintained  luminance  level.  When any of the luminance meters sense that the lighting  level  is  less  than  a  specified  set  point,  the  system  shall  provide an alert identifying the need for maintenance to  the lighting fixtures.   The  lighting  control  system  may  be  integrated  into   the SCADA system.   A  luminance  sensor,  lighting  contactors,  and  a  controller  cabinet  are  the  necessary  components  of  a  lighting  control  system.  The  sensor  sends  an  analog  signal  to  the  controller  and  the  corresponding  output  level  is  switched  on  or  off  using  lighting  contactors,  depending on the frequency received.   The use of lighting controls can greatly improve the  ability of the tunnel lighting system to adapt to changing  daylight  conditions  so  that  when  approaching  and  entering  the  tunnel,  it  is  easier  to  ascertain  conditions  directly  beyond  the  tunnel  entrance.  Illuminating  a  tunnel  roadway  to  its  highest  level  of  lighting  is  only  necessary  during  bright  and  sunny  days.  Otherwise,  considerations should be incorporated into the design to  save  energy  whenever  possible.

The  ground loads and water loads imposed on the structures  are  dependent upon  the  construction  methodology  and  particular  design  details  as  wells  as  ground  and  groundwater  conditions.  Also,  the  estimation  of  both  ground  and  water  loads  have  varying  degrees  of  uncertainty,  depending  upon  interaction  of  subsurface  conditions,  groundwater  conditions,  tunnel  lining stiffness, and construction methodology. The load  factors  included  in  this  Section  were  developed  to  address this uncertainty.   the   Other  tunnel  specific  loads  including  air  pressure,  blast loading, fire load, ship sinking, and anchor drop,  are not dependent upon the construction methodology.   Below  grade  portions  of  the  facility  include  ancillary  spaces  such  as  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  rooms  and  cross  passages  that  are  built  between  tunnel.  roadway  portions  of  Underground  spaces  constructed  in  conjunction  with  support buildings are not included in this specification.   the   the   this  Section  specifies   This Section supplements the LRFD Specifications.  the  minimum  As  such,  requirements  for  loads  and  forces,  the  limits  of  their  application, load factors, and load combinations used for  the  design  of  the  following  types  of  new  highway  tunnels:  •   Cut-and-cover  tunnel  structures  in  soil  and  rock   •  Mined tunnel structures in soil and rock  •   Bored  tunnel  structures  in  soil  and  rock  constructed  using  Tunnel  Boring  Machines  (TBM)  Immersed tunnel structures in soil and rock   •   The loads contained in this Section are applicable to  the  below  grade  portions  of  the  tunnel  facility  only.

Active Earth Pressure—Lateral pressure resulting from the retention of the soil by a structure or component that is  tending to move away from the soil mass.   Apparent Earth Pressure (AEP)—Lateral  pressure applied to an excavation supported either by  multiple levels of  internal bracing or ground anchors, which is sequentially excavated downward from the ground surface. Apparent  earth pressure diagrams derived from empirical observations are used to design both the earth retention wall elements  and the internal bracing elements or ground anchors.   At-rest  Earth Pressure—Lateral  pressure  existing  in  the soil  before  it  is  disturbed by  excavation. At-rest  pressure  magnitude is a function of the soil formation process and the stress history of the soil subsequent to formation.   Conventionally  Mined  Tunnel—A  tunnel  mined  using  controlled  blasting  methods  or  some  form  of  mechanical  excavation other than a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM).   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Design Water Depth—Water depth at mean high water in tidal water bodies, or defined flood stage for interior streams,  or maximum pool elevation for streams controlled by dams or other flood control facilities, such as levees. Water  depth used to determine design water pressures for sub-aqueous tunnels.    Distortion—Change in structural geometry.   Dynamic  Load  Allowance—An  increase  in  the  applied  static  force  effects  to  account  for  the  dynamic  interaction  between the tunnel and moving vehicles, and for air pressures associated with vehicle movement and the operation of  tunnel ventilation systems.    Extreme—A maximum or minimum.   Final  Lining—The  permanent  tunnel  structure,  constructed  within  an  excavation  which  has  been  supported  by  temporary (initial) support elements installed concurrently with excavation.   Fixtures—Fixtures  include  lighting,  signs,  signals,  fans,  and  other  mechanical  equipment,  conduits,  suspended  ceilings, roadway slabs supporting traffic over ventilation ducts, and other items attached to the tunnel walls.   Lane—The area of roadway receiving one vehicle or one uniform load line.   Lithification—The process for the formation of sedimentary rock from compaction or consolidation of soil under the  weight of overlying material, often accompanied by the deposition of cementing material in the pore space of the soil.   Normally Consolidated Soil—A soil for which the current effective overburden pressure is the same as the maximum  pressure that has been experienced.   Overconsolidated  Soil—A  soil  that  has  been  under  greater  overburden  pressure  than  currently  exists.  Overconsolidated soils generally exhibit greater at-rest earth pressures than normally consolidated soils.    Overconsolidation Ratio—Ratio of the maximum preconsolidation pressure to the overburden pressure.   Passive Earth Pressure—Lateral pressure resulting from the soil’s resistance to the lateral movement of a structure or  component into the soil mass.   Permanent Loads—Loads and forces that are, or are assumed to be, either constant upon completion of construction  or varying only over a long time interval.   Rock—Material  that  is  formed  by  the  lithification  of  soil,  the  cooling  and  solidification  of  molten  magma,  or  the  alteration of existing rocks under conditions of high pressure and high temperature.   Soil—Natural material derived from the decomposition and weathering of rock. Soil that remains in place at its point  of  formation  is  called  residual  soil.  Soil  that  is  eroded,  transported  away  from  the  location  of  its  formation,  and  deposited at a remote location is called transported soil.   Squeezing  Ground—Ground  which  generates  potentially  large  pressures  on  final  linings  and  causes  distortion  or  failure of temporary (initial) support elements from the release of stresses which have developed over time. Squeezing  ground generally consists of weak claystones, mudstones, shales, overconsolidated clays, and soft clays.   Sub-aqueous Tunnel—A tunnel constructed beneath a body of water.   Swelling Ground—Ground containing minerals that expand upon absorption of water, which can generate pressures  on final linings and cause significant distortion or failure of temporary (initial) support elements.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

This  variable  reflects  that  the  Strength and Extreme Event limit state load factors for  the various permanent loads are not single constants, but  they can have two extreme values. Table 3.4-2 provides  these two extreme values for the various permanent load  factors, maximum and minimum. Permanent loads are  always present, but the nature of uncertainty is that the  actual  loads  may  be  more  or  less  than  the  nominal  specified  design  values.  Therefore,  maximum  and  minimum load factors reflect this uncertainty.   The  maximum  and  minimum  values  of  the  load  factors  do not  represent  a  range of  values;  rather  they  represent  two  values  that  should  be  used  when  developing  possible  load  combinations.  All  possible  combinations should be developed using the two values  given.  Load  combinations  using  values  between  the  maximum and minimum values should not be used for  design.   to   •  Strength T-I—Basic load combination relating  to  permanent  ground  loading  conditions  that  develop  over  time  after  the  completion  of  construction, and to the normal vehicular use of  the structure.

The Owner  may,  at  its  discretion  and  after  performing  a  hazard  analysis  create  load  combinations  that  have more than one of these loads applied to the  structure  simultaneously.  In  this  case,  it  is  recommended  that  the  load  factors  shown  in  Table 3.4-1 be used when combining the loads.  •  Extreme  Event  T-III—Load  combination  relating to flood or tsunami used to check the  resistance  of  the  underground  construction  to  the effects of buoyancy.   •  Service  T-I—Load  combination  relating  to  permanent  ground  loading  conditions  that  develop  over  time  after  completion  of  construction and to the normal vehicular use of  the structure.

Anchored  walls  have  the  bracing  elements  external  to  the  excavation,  braced  walls  have  the  bracing elements internal to the excavation.   the   AEP  diagrams  for   temporary  braced  condition  of  deep  excavations  have  been  developed  on the basis of field measurements to approximate the  distribution of lateral earth pressure upon SOE walls.  The  envelope  of  expected  maximum  pressures  and  their distribution along the SOE wall are affected by  the excavation process and cannot be determined by  conventional  lateral  earth  pressure  theory.  These  diagrams  are  used  for  the  temporarily  braced  condition. For permanent lateral earth loads, refer to  the LRFD Specifications.   Construction of cut-and-cover tunnels in urban  and  suburban  areas  usually  requires  a  braced  excavation  to  control  deformations  and  adverse  impact on adjacent surficial development. When SOE  walls are also used as the permanent walls, they are  typically  braced  in  a  temporary  condition  until  the  permanent  structural  slabs  are  constructed.  The  provisions  of  this  section  are  intended  for  checking  the SOE walls in this temporary condition.    Bracing  of  excavations  can  consist  of  struts  extending  across  the  excavation  or  ground  anchors  installed  through  the  SOE  wall  into  the  adjacent  ground.  Use  of  ground  anchors  requires  the  acquisition of temporary construction easements and  staging  of  the  construction  of  the  final  structure  to  accommodate de-stressing of the ground anchors.   Support of braced excavations is designed on the  basis of AEP diagrams. These diagrams are based on  empirical  of  deformations  and  member  stresses  that  have  been  acquired over the years.    and  measurement   experience   For  more  commentary,  please  refer  to  Article   C3.11.5.7 of the LRFD Specifications.   The  at-rest  and  active  lateral  earth  pressure  coefficients  for  cohesionless  soils  can  be  estimated  using  equations  included  in  Articles  3.11.5.2  and  3.11.5.7.1 of the LRFD Specifications, respectively.   In  general, numerical  methods  may  be  used  to  estimate deformations if necessary once the structural  members  are  designed  based  on  the  AEP  diagrams.  The numerical methods shall not be used to evaluate  the  ground  pressures  for  these  structures  unless  approved  by  the  Owner  and  verified  by  prior  local  experience.   Depending  upon  available  right-of-way,  cut- and-cover tunnels in exurban and rural areas can be  constructed  within  open  excavations  with  properly  designed sideslopes.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Ubiquitous Joint Method   for   (Q)   This method proposes the use of a Tunneling Quality  rock  mass  the  determination  of  Index  characteristics  and  tunnel  support  requirements.  This  method  is  based  on  field  observation  and  case  histories  and  does  not  take  into  account  the  concept  of  ground– structure interaction.    For  conventional  two-lane  or  three-lane  highway tunnels with a total excavation width in  the range of 40 to 55 feet, use a maximum apex  height of 15 feet.    An  envelope  is  drawn  through  the  wedge  apices and the rock load (ksf) is the total weight  of  rock  beneath  the  envelope,  divided  by  the  opening width.   In  this  method,  rock  wedges  developed  from  discontinuity  information  developed  by  the  subsurface  investigation  program  are  drawn  to  scale  on  a  tunnel  cross-section. Apparent dip angle and dip directions are  plotted, oriented to the azimuth of the tunnel longitudinal  axis. This method requires the assumption of a maximum  wedge  apex  height.  Apex  heights  greater  than  15  feet  would be unusual.   This  load  shall  be  directly  applied  for  the  design of the final lining, using appropriate load  factors  and  resistance  factors,  and  using  either  total  unit  weight  of  the  rock  or  buoyant  unit  weight,  groundwater  conditions.   depending   upon   The total unit weight rock load shall be used  for design of temporary (initial) support such as  rock  reinforcement  or  direct  rock  support  such  lattice  girders,  without  as  steel  considering  water  pressure  (for  cases  where  excavation drains the rock mass or substantially  reduces water pressure on the joints).    ribs  or   b)  Analytical Methods   1.

Computer  software  that  develops  the  size  and  shape  of  wedges  formed  in  the  rock  mass surrounding a tunnel excavation based  upon  the  geometry  and  orientation  of  the  joint sets.    c)  Numerical Methods   This method is limited to use with simple geometries  and material models and is therefore of limited practical  value. This method is considered useful for checking the  reasonableness  of  the  design  developed  using  other  methodologies.   This  method  relates  internal  support  pressure  to  tunnel  wall  convergence.  This  method  is  based  on  an  assumed elastic behavior of the support, and its ability to  resist  the  deformation  of  the  surrounding  rock  resulting  from the excavation. Although this method accounts for  structure–ground interaction, it does not fully account for  the  ability  of  the  rock  to  support  itself  with  nominal  resistance from the supporting structure.   This concept is based on the true behavior of rock  bolts: to act as reinforcement of the rock arch around the  opening.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Surcharge  loads  shall  include  loads  from  existing  buildings  and  other  infrastructure foundations, loads from planned or future  development, and surcharge from future sedimentation or  landslides that could be applied to the tunnel.   The factored soil stress increase on the tunnel wall or  lining caused by concentrated surcharge loads or stresses  from  structures  constructed  adjacent  to  or  above  the  tunnel alignment shall be calculated using the unfactored  surcharge loads generated by the structure multiplied by  the load factor ES.   Concentrated surcharge loads induced by buildings  and other foundations are typically the result of dead load,  live  load,  wind  load,  and  possibly  other  loads  that  are  associated with load factors other than ES. However, the  controlling uncertainty in load prediction for surcharges  is the transmission of the surcharge load through the soil  to  the  tunnel  below  the  surface.  Hence,  ES  should  be  applied to the unfactored concentrated surcharge loads.   When  available,  construction  plans  and  other  information  regarding  existing  buildings  should  be  consulted to establish realistic surcharge load values and  to determine the point of application of the loads relative  to the position of the tunnel.   3.5.4—Piping Loads (PI)   Loads  due   to  piping  for  water  supply  and  firefighting/protection  piping  shall  be  determined  according to the following:   •  Fixed  fire  suppression  (deluge/sprinkler  system)—  NFPA 13   •  Standpipe—NFPA 14  •  Water main serving both type systems—NFPA 24   •   Ice  accumulation  of  1/2  inch  around  the  entire  perimeter of an exposed pipe in conditions where ice  can form on pipes   3.6—LIVE LOADS   3.6.1—Gravity Loads (LL and PL)   3.6.1.1—Vehicular Live Load (LL)   C3.6.1.1   Tunnel  components  subject  to  highway  vehicular  loads  and/or  loads  associated  with  specialized  vehicles  used  for  tunnel  maintenance  and  operations  shall  be  designed  in  accordance  with  Article  3.6.1  of  the  LRFD  Specifications.

The minimum live load stipulated here accounts for  personnel  carrying  small  tools  and  light  equipment  into  the air duct for the purposes of maintenance and repairs.  Tunnel owners may elect to design suspended ceilings for  larger  incorporate  any  special  operational aspects of the tunnel into the design loading  for the ceilings.   loads  and  should   These underground spaces may be used in the event  of an emergency evacuation of the tunnel and as such can  be congested with motorists exiting the tunnel. Therefore  a larger live load is specified for these spaces.   A  pedestrian  load  of  0.075  ksf  shall  be  applied  to  components inside the roadway portion of the tunnel that  are subject to pedestrian loads.   The pedestrian live load to be applied to components  outside  the  roadway  portion  of  the  tunnel  shall  be  determined by the planned use for the space.    A minimum live load of 0.1 ksf shall be applied to  suspended ceilings over roadways that enclose ventilation  ducts large enough for personnel to enter. This load shall  be  applied  to  the  suspended  ceiling  in  a  manner  that  causes the maximum load effect to the components, the  connections,  and  attachments  the  suspended ceiling systems.   that  comprise   Ancillary  spaces  such  as  staircases,  corridors,  and  cross  passages  adjacent  to  or  between  tunnels  shall  be  designed for a minimum pedestrian live load of 0.15 ksf.   Spaces containing machinery should be designed for  a live load consistent with the use of the space and local  building codes.    Pedestrian  railings  shall  be  designed  in  accordance   with Section 13 of the LRFD Specifications.   3.6.1.3—Vehicular Dynamic Load Allowance (IM)   The static effect of the design truck or tandem, other  than centrifugal or braking force, shall be increased by the  percentage  specified  in  Article  3.6.2.1  of  the  LRFD  Specifications.    3.6.1.4—Attachment Dynamic Load Allowance (IA)   The static effects of mechanical equipment and water  lines shall be increased to account for the dynamic effects  of  starting,  stopping,  and  operating  the  machinery  and  water lines.

See  Sections  6,  7,  and  8  for  additional information.   Groundwater elevations shall be determined as part  of the subsurface investigation program. Seasonal, flood,  and  tidal  variations  in  groundwater  elevations  shall  be  determined  as  part  of  the  subsurface  investigation  program.    Water loads applied to the tunnel shall be the actual  hydrostatic pressure applied to the tunnel as determined  by the ground water elevation or water surface elevation  as  determined  in  the  subsurface  investigation.  The  hydrostatic pressure shall vary linearly across the height  of the tunnel from crown to invert according to the depth.  Water loads for cases where the tunnel is constructed  within  a  confined  aquifer  shall  be  based  on  the  groundwater pressures within the aquifer.   Water  loads  may  be  reduced  if  an  active  drainage  system  is  installed  in  the  tunnel.  If  an  active  drainage  system is installed, the actual loading applied to the tunnel  shall  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  groundwater  flow  rates.

The effects of tsunami and flood water shall  be  considered  in  the  design  and  shall  not  be  combined  with other extreme loads.    When designing for resistance to buoyancy, only the  permanent  structural  loads  shall  be  used  to  resist  the  effects  of  buoyancy.  The  weight  of  items  that  could  be  removed  from  the  tunnel  such  as  machinery,  lighting  fixtures, signs, signals, and architectural finishes shall not  be included in the calculation of the resisting forces.   See  Article  8.7.1.2.1  for  transient  water  loads  for   immersed tunnels.   A  tsunami  is  in  effect  a  very  long  period  wave,  usually led by the trough. Typical effects of the trough are  that it reduces the water level in front of sea walls without  giving  time  for  the  water  level  behind  to  fall,  toppling  walls towards the sea.   3.8—AIR PRESSURE LOADS (AP)   C3.8   AP  are  developed  from  two  sources:  the  tunnel  ventilation  system  and  vehicles  passing  through  the  tunnel.

In  the  absence  of  more  detailed  analysis,  the  air  pressure exerted on attachments to the tunnel interior due  to  passing  vehicles  may  be  taken  as  10  psf.  This  force  effect shall be applied in both directions and act in a load  reversal manner.   The number of cycles for use in the fatigue design of  attachments shall be determined based on the number of  trucks  expected  to  pass  through  the  tunnel  during  the  anticipated service life of the attachment.   3.9—EARTHQUAKE EFFECTS (EQ)   See Section 10 for calculation of earthquake effects.   The  transient  air  pressures  from  the  ventilation  system and the passing of vehicles can be the source of  repetitive  loading  that  requires  a  check  for  fatigue.

In  frame  analysis  software,  secondary  forces  are  generally  obtained  by  subtracting  the  primary  prestress  forces from the total prestressing.   3.11—BLAST LOADING (BL)   C3.11   Where it has been determined that a tunnel or tunnel  intentional  or  the  following  shall  be   component  shall  be  designed  unintentional  blast  effects,  considered:   for   •  Size of explosive charge  •  Shape of explosive charge  •  Type of explosive  •  Stand-off distance  •  Location of the charge  •  Possible  modes  of  delivery  and  associated  capacities  (e.g.,  maximum  charge  weight  will  depend  upon  the  delivery  method  and  can  include pedestrians, cars, trucks, buses, etc.)  •  Fragmentation associated with vehicle-delivered   explosives   The  size,  shape,  location,  and  type  of  explosive  charge determine the intensity of the blast effect produced  by an explosion. For comparison purposes, all explosive  charges are typically converted to their equivalent TNT  charge weights.   Explosions  inside  a  tunnel  create  effects  very  different  from  an  explosion  in  the  open  air.  When  an  explosion  occurs  in  a  tunnel,  the  peak  pressure  and  the  impulse  associated  with  the  shock  front  are  extremely  high and amplified by the confining structure. Because of  the close-in effects of the explosion and the amplification  of  the  blast  pressures  due  to  reflections  within  the  structure, the distribution of the shock loads on any one  surface is non-uniform and extremely complicated.   An explosion in an underground structure produces  an air blast that interacts with the tunnel surface and may  also  induce  damage  to  the  surrounding  ground.  The  underground  features  (tunnel  lining  and  surrounding  ground)  go  through  several  cycles  of  expansion  and  rebound (reflection) due to the shock interactions between  the tunnel boundary and the air. The rebound motion is  considered  to  be  the  most  critical  with  regard  to  the  potential  separation  of  a  liner  from  its  confining  surrounding  grout  and/or  ground.  After  or  during  separation  and  fragmentation  of  the  liner,  the  dynamic  wave  propagates  through  the  surrounding  medium,  potentially damaging adjacent structures and surface and  underground  utilities.  The  disruption  of  the  intimate  contact  between  the  tunnel  lining  and  the  surrounding  medium  can  cause  additional  instability  in  the  tunnel  lining  due  to  the  fact  that  the  tunnel  lining  and  surrounding ground rely on each other for stability. This  loss of surrounding ground support can lead to secondary  damage  due  to  unanticipated  loading  on  the  lining  resulting in collapse of the tunnel lining.   Other modes of failure of a tunnel lining due to blast  include excessive cracking that leads to excessive water  the  infiltration  and   tunnels  under   flooding   for   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Breaching of the tunnel lining can also  lead to flooding or the inflow of surrounding earth. The  loss of ground surrounding the tunnel due a breach could  lead to collapse of the tunnel lining or settlement at the  surface.   Post-blast  analysis  of  the  effects  of  the  explosion  should be a component of the investigation into the effects  of the blast.   Information on blast loads and their effect on tunnels  may  be  found  in  S.  Choi  (2009),  FHWA  (2003),  and  NCHRP (2006).   3.12—FIRE LOAD (FI)   C3.12   Tunnel  elements  essential  to  the  stability  of  the  opening  include  any  element  in  direct  contact  with  the  surrounding  ground  and  any  element  that  supports  or  braces  an  element  in  direct  contact  with  the  ground.  Owners may elect to include other components or tunnel  elements in this category at their discretion.   Additional information can be obtained from the ITA  Guidelines  for  Structural  Fire  Resistance  of  Road  Tunnels  (Russell,  2004)  and  NCHRP  Synthesis  415  (Maevski, 2011).   Tunnel  elements  essential  to  the  stability  of  the  opening  that  are  directly  exposed  to  the  effects  of  a  vehicle fire in the roadway portion of the tunnel shall be  designed to resist the heat released by the design fire for  a  minimum  of  1  hour.  Analysis  of  heat  transfer  to  the  material that includes material behavior as it absorbs the  heat shall be performed.   Alternately,  essential   tunnel  elements  can  be  protected  from  exposure  to  heat  by  sacrificial  layers,  protective  coatings,  or  protective  boards.  Protective  measures shall be designed to provide protection against  the heat released by the design fire for a minimum of 1  hour with a maximum temperature at the surface of the  protected element of 250º C.   3.13—SHIP SINKING (SS)   The  primary  sunken  ship  design  case  for  Extreme  Event Limit State T-II shall be assumed to result from a  ship of the size approximating those using or expected to  use  the  waterway  and  which  has  the  most  severe  load  effect  on  the  tunnel.  In  lieu  of  more  accurate  data,  the  imposed  loading  of  a  sunken  ship  resting  on  the  tunnel  may be taken as a uniformly distributed loading over an  area  not  exceeding  the  full  width  of  the  tunnel  times  a  length as measured on the longitudinal axis of the tunnel  of 100 ft.    The intensity of an appropriate uniformly distributed  loading  from  a  sunken  ship  may  be  determined  by  methods  such  as  those  outlined  in  Chapter  6  of  the  International  Tunneling  Association  Immersed  and  Floating  Tunnels  State  of  the  Art  Report  (1997),where  typical values may also be found.   If  appropriate,  based  on  marine  traffic  for  Extreme  Event T-II, a secondary sunken ship design case shall be  assumed to consist of a smaller vessel, such as a ferry or  barge, sinking and impacting the tunnel structure with the  stem or sternpost in a manner similar to that of a dropped  anchor.  In  lieu  of  more  accurate  data  for  the  secondary  sunken ship, a static equivalent concentrated load of 225  kips working on an area of 3.3 × 6.6 ft² directly on the  tunnel roof may be considered.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Aspect ratio—The nominal length of an individual steel fiber divided by the diameter of the fiber.   Dosage—The mass of fibers per unit volume of concrete.   Flexural  stress—Force  per  unit  area  at  a  given  distance  from  the  neutral  axis,  determined  using  linear  elastic  assumptions.   Lattice girder—a ground support element consisting of an open lattice of three or four steel bars connected by lacing  bars and encapsulated with shotcrete, which is sprayed through the open-work lattice.   Modulus of rupture—The peak flexural strength of an unreinforced test beam.   Net deflection—The deflection of a beam specimen, measured at mid-span, excluding any extraneous effects due to  seating or twisting of the specimen on its supports or deformation of the support and loading system.   Neutral axis—The plane of zero stress in a member subjected to flexural stresses.   Peak flexural strength—The maximum flexural tensile stress recorded in a beam test. For a fiber volume fraction of  less than approximately 0.5 percent, the peak strength is equal to the modulus of rupture.   Residual flexural strength—The flexural tensile stress recorded in a beam test at a stated mid-span deflection.    Shotcrete—Sprayed concrete applied as dry mix or wet mix by pneumatic methods. Shotcrete may be either plain  shotcrete, applied alone or reinforced with welded wire fabric, glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) fabric, or steel fiber- reinforced shotcrete (SFRS), which includes deformed steel fibers distributed throughout the shotcrete. Thin layers of  shotcrete (less than 4 in. [100 mm] nominal thickness) placed as surface protection to prevent raveling behaves as  membranes. Greater thicknesses should be analyzed as structural members, either alone or compositely with lattice  girders.   Toughness—The  amount  of  energy  absorbed  during  the  cracking  process.  When  a  steel  fiber-reinforced  concrete  (FRC) specimen is tested in flexure, toughness is defined as the area under the load–deflection curve up to a certain  deflection. Toughness represents the ability of FRC to sustain load after it cracks.    Volume fraction—The concentration of fibers in concrete, defined as the volume of fibers per unit volume of concrete.   4.3—NOTATION   For notations not shown, see the LRFD Specifications or the reference document associated with the definition.

Cracking is a source of leakage in  underground structures. Limiting cracking through more  restrictive  service  requirements  combined  with  dense  concrete  mixes  will  tend  to  minimize  leaks  associated  with cracking.   The  service  limit  state  shall  be  investigated  in  accordance with the applicable requirements of Section  5  of  the  LRFD  Specifications  with  the  following  modifications:   •  The spacing, s, of mild steel reinforcement bars  in the layer closest to the tension face shall be  0.95  times  that  calculated  in  accordance  with  the LRFD Specifications.  •  The  provisions  governing   the  control  of  cracking  by  distribution  of  reinforcement  are  not applicable to structural plain concrete.  •  Deformations for structural plain concrete shall  be  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  latest  edition  of  the  American  Concrete  Institute’s  Building  Code  Requirements  for  Structural  Concrete (ACI 318).   •  Deformations  for  fiber  reinforced  shotcrete  shall  be  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  LRFD Specifications.   •  The provisions  governing the stress limits for  concrete  are  not  applicable  to  structural  plain  concrete or to fiber-reinforced concrete.   4.5.1.2—Fatigue Limit State   The  fatigue  limit  state  shall  be  investigated  in  requirements  of  the  applicable  accordance  with  Section 5 of the LRFD Specifications with the following  modifications:   •  Fatigue  shall  be   investigated  for   tunnel  roadway  slabs  constructed  over  ventilation  ducts and any other concrete element subjected  to repetitive loading.   •  The  fatigue  limit  state  is  not  applicable  to  structural  plain  concrete  or  fiber-reinforced  concrete.   4.5.1.3—Strength Limit State   C4.5.1.3   The  strength  limit  state  shall  be  investigated  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Section  5  of  the  LRFD Specifications with the following modifications.

Strain within the  surrounding ground continues to change with time until  a  final  condition  of  equilibrium  is  reached  which  will  result  in  the  final  load  effects  imposed  on  the  tunnel  structure. The load effects during both the short-term (or  temporary)  condition  and  the  long-term  (or  final)  condition are checked using the strength limit state.   In  addition  to  the  load  effects  produced  by  the  surrounding  ground,  construction  processes  may  also  produce  load  effects  that  are  temporary,  but  must  be  resisted by the structural component. The strength limit  state is used to check for construction-process imposed  loadings.  Examples  of  this  type  of  load  include  the  handling, transportation, and installation loads imposed  on  precast  concrete  components  such  as  segmental  tunnel  tunnel  components.   immersed   concrete   linings   and   4.5.1.4—Extreme Event Limit State   The tunnel system, including appurtenances inside  the tunnel, shall be proportioned to resist collapse due to  earthquakes, tsunami, floods, and fires.

Concrete mix designs should be formulated to result  in dense concrete to minimize the potential of leakage  through  the  concrete.  Dense  concrete  mixes  can  be  subject  to  shrinkage  cracking.  When  designing  dense  concrete mixes, the effects of heat of hydration and the  formation of  shrinkage cracking should be considered,  and  the  mix  formulated  to  minimize  shrinkage  cracks.  The  intent  of  the  mix  design  should  be  a  durable  concrete with low permeability.   4.5.2.2—Design Considerations   C4.5.2.2   Components and connections shall be designed to  resist load combinations as specified in Section 3 at all  stages  during  the  life  of  the  tunnel,  including  during  construction.

The use of FRC shall be limited to the following:  a)  Members  that  are  in  continuous  contact  with  the ground on one face in a manner such that  ground–structure interaction is ensured.   b)  Members  for  which  arch  action  minimizes  flexural tension under all conditions of loading.   The  use  of   synthetic  reinforcement  for  concrete  prohibited.   fibers  as   tunnel  components   structural  is   If  lightweight  concrete  is  used  in  FRC,  all  design  parameters  must  be  determined  through  laboratory  testing.   4.5.4.1—Material Properties   The  provisions  of  this  article  are  based  upon  research summarized in Fiber Reinforced Concrete for  Precast Tunnel Structures (Smith, 2011).    To  limit  flexural  tension,  and  to  maintain  at  least  half  the  segment  thickness  in  compression,  it  is  recommended  to  limit  the  eccentricity  of  the  line  of  thrust (Mu/Nu) to h/3.   Concrete  tunnel  components  are  often  exposed  to  extreme  heat  during  fire  incidents  inside  the  tunnel.  Exposure  to  high  temperatures  will  cause  synthetic  fibers  to  melt  which  destroys  their  load  carrying  capacity.  Synthetic  fibers  may  be  used  to  increase  the  resistance of the concrete to explosive spalling during a  fire event.    The use of lightweight concrete is not recommended   for FRC.    4.5.4.1.1—Steel Fibers   C4.5.4.1.1   Steel fibers shall be cut from cold drawn wire and  shall  meet  the  requirements  of  ASTM  A820  fiber   Type 1.   •  Anchorage and Bond   Steel  fibers  shall  be  deformed  to  enhance  the  pull out strength of the fiber.   Performance  of  the  product  selected  for  inclusion in the FRC shall be verified through  testing.   •  Tensile Strength   The  minimum  tensile  strength  of  steel  fibers  shall  be  150  ksi.  The  tensile  strength  of  the  fiber shall be such that that it will pull out of  the concrete prior to breaking.  The tensile strength and pullout performance of  the steel fiber selected for inclusion in the FRC   Deformed fibers are specified to increase the pullout  strength  of  the  fibers.  The  pullout  strength  combined  with  the  bond  strength  between  the  fiber  and  the  concrete accounts for the strength and toughness of the  FRC.   Deformed  fibers  are  available  in  a  variety  of  configurations.  The  performance  of  FRC  is  dependent  on  the  configuration  of  the  deformation  and  surface  qualities of the fiber, combined with the properties of the  concrete mix.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Examples of components for which the assumption  of linearly varying  strains  may not be suitable include  deep  components  such  as  deep  beams,  corbels,  and  brackets as defined in the LRFD Specifications.   4.5.4.3.2—Assumptions for Strength and Extreme Limit   C4.5.4.3.2   States    When  calculating  combined  axial  and  flexural  strength, reduce the nominal section thickness by 1 in.  to account for corrosion of the fibers on the tension face.  Factored  resistance  of  FRC  components  shall  be  based  on  the  conditions  of  equilibrium  and  strain  compatibility,  the  resistance  factors  as  specified  in  Article 4.5.4.2, and the following assumptions:  •  The maximum usable strain at the extreme concrete  compression  fiber  shall  not  be  taken  greater  than  0.003.   •  The  relationship  between  concrete  compressive  stress and strain may be considered satisfied by an  equivalent rectangular concrete compressive stress  block of 0.85 f’c over a zone bounded by the edges  of  the  cross-section  and  a  straight  line  located  parallel  to  the  neutral  axis  at  the  distance  a  = β1c  from the extreme compression fiber. The distance c  shall be measured perpendicular to the neutral axis.  The  factor  β1  shall  be  taken  as  0.85  for  concrete  strengths  not  exceeding  4.0  ksi.  For  concrete  strengths exceeding 4.0 ksi, β1 shall be reduced at a  rate of 0.05 for each 1.0 ksi of strength in excess of  4.0 ksi, except that β1 shall not be taken to be less  than 0.65.   •  The  maximum  usable  tensile  strain  shall  be  set  at  0.005, which is estimated to occur at a test specimen  deflection  at  mid-span  of  3  mm  as  per  ASTM  C1609. The associated stress at the extreme tension  fiber is σ3.   •  The relationship between tensile stress in the fiber  matrix and strain, may be considered satisfied by an  equivalent rectangular concrete tensile stress block  of σ3 over a zone bounded by the edges of the cross- section and the neutral axis.   where σ3 = 0.37 f150,3.0                           (4.5.4.3.2-1)   f150,3.0 is described in Article 4.5.4.3.3.   The stress–strain relationships stated in this section  are applicable to FRC meeting the requirements of this  specification. Alternative stress–strain relationships can  be  derived  in  accordance  with  ACI  544.8  (Report  on  Indirect  Method  to  Obtain  Stress-Strain  Response  of  Fiber-Reinforced Concrete), subject to approval by the  owner.   Strain compatibility equations are typically used to  generate interaction diagrams that define the capacity of  a  member  under  different  flexural  and  axial  load  conditions. Load cases are plotted on the same diagram,  and  the  factor  of  safety  determined.  The  demand  and  capacity must be determined for a consistent length of  tunnel, such as per linear foot.   stress  block   An  equivalent   is  rectangular  recommended. A more precise stress–strain relationship  can be developed, with stress varying from zero at the  neutral axis, increasing to a maximum value of σ2 close  to  the  neutral  axis,  and  reducing  to  σ3  at  the  extreme  tension  fiber.  However,  the  added  precision  and  complexity  generally  provide  minimal  increase  in  capacity.   The  0.37  factor  converts   the  flexural  stress  calculated  assuming  linear-elastic  behavior  to  direct  tensile  stress  assuming  cracked  behavior,  with  rectangular  stress  blocks.

Definitions  and  notation  shall  be  as  per  the  latest  edition of the American Concrete Institute’s Guide for  Specifying Underground Shotcrete (ACI 506.5R).   Shotcrete  proportions  shall  be  selected  that  allow  suitable  placement  procedures  using  the  delivery  equipment selected and shall result in finished in-place  hardened shotcrete meeting the strength requirements of  this specification.   Supplementary cementitious materials like fly ash,  silica fume, and slag cement  may be used in shotcrete  applications  to  improve  workability,  durability,  and  chemical resistance.   Steel fibers may be used in shotcrete to improve the  flexural strength, ductility, and toughness. Plastic fibers  shall not be used for these purposes.   but  hardened  properties  are  operator-dependent.  Because shotcrete is installed at a high velocity, it will  have a higher density than conventional concrete in most  cases.  The  increased  density  will  provide  reduced  permeability  and  higher  durability.  Shotcrete  mixtures  can  in  fact  exceed  the  compressive  strength  of  most  mixtures  used  for  placed  walls.  The  compaction  that  occurs  during  application  of  shotcrete  helps  achieve  improved compressive strength and durability, and low  water–cementitious material ratios of shotcrete mixtures  produce other benefits, including reduced shrinkage and  lower permeability. A well designed shotcrete mix that  provides  the  proper  material  properties  for  shotcrete  placement  is  essential  to  the  successful  installation  of  the product.   Proper  placement  is  an  important  component  in  achieving good shotcrete results. Defects that occur in  shotcrete can be due to poor placement. Proper handling  of  the  material  components  of  the  shotcrete  at  the  construction  site  is  also  an  important  component  in  achieving good shotcrete results.   Synthetic  (polypropylene)  fibers  may  be  used  in  shotcrete  to  improve  placement,  limit  cracking,  and  improve performance during fires. Synthetic fibers are  not  permitted  for  strength  applications  due  to  the  fact  that they melt during fire events.   4.5.5.1—Details of Reinforcement   C4.5.5.1   For  additional   information  with   to  reinforcement details see the latest edition of ACI 506R  Guide  to  Shotcrete,  Reported  by  ACI  Committee  506,  and the “International Building Code”.   regard   Reinforcement details shall be in accordance  with  these   the  LRFD  Specifications,  Article  4.5.2  of  Specifications, and as specified herein:   •  The  maximum  size  of  reinforcement  shall  be  No.  5  bars  unless  it  is  demonstrated  by  preconstruction tests that adequate encasement  of larger bars will be achieved.    •  When No. 5 or smaller bars are used, there shall  be  a  minimum  clearance  between  parallel  reinforcement bars of 2 1/2 in.

The  shotcrete  between  the  girders  acts  as  lagging between these arches.    The main advantage of the lattice girder is its ability  in working with shotcrete. Because of the open nature of  the lattice girder\\'s construction, shotcrete passes through  it,  reducing  the  potential  for  unconsolidated  shotcrete  areas  behind  the  girder.  The  shotcrete  can  be  applied  evenly, producing an integral lining.

Lattice  girders  provide  important  functions  in  the   tunneling process.

The  structural  design  of   tunnel  components  constructed  from  lattice  girders  shall  conform  to  the  requirements  of  Article  4.5  except  as  modified  or  supplemented herein:   •  All lattice girders shall consist of three or four  primary retaining bars connected by stiffening  components.   •  The spacing and size of the bars used in a lattice  girder  shall  be  designed  to  allow  shotcrete  to  penetrate  into,  and  behind,  the  girder  with  a  minimum of shotcrete shadows.    •  The  maximum  centerline  spacing  of   the  stiffening components shall be less than three  times the height of the girder to assure stability  against buckling.   Some  important  aspects  for  designing  the  lattice  girders  that  shall  be  considered  during  the  design  process are:   •  Required  rigidity,  capacity,  and  moment   characteristics.   •  Avoidance of shotcrete voids (shadowing) for   complete encapsulation.   •  Required shotcrete lining thickness and cover   to steel.   4.8.1.1—Definitions   Refer  to  Articles  5.2  and  6.2  of  the  LRFD  Specifications for definitions applicable to this section.    4.8.1.2—Notation   Refer  to  Articles  5.3  and  6.3  of  the  LRFD   Specifications for notation applicable to this section.   4.8.2—Material Properties   Refer to Articles 4.4 and 4.5 for material properties.   4.8.3—Limit States   4.8.3.1—General   The structural behavior of the components made of  steel,  or  steel  in  combination  with  concrete,  shall  be  investigated  for  each  stage  that  may  be  critical  during  construction,  handling,  transportation,  and  erection  as  well as during the service life of the structure of which  they are part.

The  information gathered during the investigation program  will  also  be  used  for  geotechnical  design  analyses,  constructability  studies,  and  the  development  of  geotechnical  reports.  The  provisions  included  in  this  section  are  based  on  the  guidelines  presented  in  Technical Manual for Design and Construction of Road  Tunnels—Civil  Elements  (AASHTO,  2010),  relevant  provisions included in AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design  the  LRFD  Specifications  (herein  referred  the  FHWA  Geotechnical  Specifications),  Engineering  Circular  No.  5  –  Evaluation  of  Soil  and  Rock Properties (FHWA, 2002).   to  as   and   geologic,   topographic,   Successful planning, design, and construction of a  highway  tunnel  requires  the  use  of  various  types  of  investigative techniques to obtain a broad spectrum of  pertinent  subsurface,  hydrogeological,  and  structural  information  and  data.  Although most of these techniques and procedures are  similar to those applied for roadway and bridge projects,  the  specific  scope,  objective,  and  focus  of  the  investigations  are  considerably  different  for  tunnel  projects  and  can  vary  significantly  with  subsurface  conditions and tunneling methods.

Rock units range from thinly bedded (less than 2 inches between  bedding planes) to massively bedded (greater than 10 feet between bedding planes).   Bedding plane—A smooth, continuous plane in a sedimentary rock unit, parallel to the bedding; often a weakness  plane.   Boulder—A rock fragment with a maximum edge dimension greater than 12 inches, with no upward limit. Boulders  may be found disseminated throughout deposits of cohesionless and cohesive soil or may be concentrated in dense  layers.   Breccia—A zone of fractured rock often associated with a fault. If the breccia zone is porous, it can be a source of  significant initial and sustained water inflows into a tunnel excavation. The breccia zone may include soil material  filling the pore space between rock fragments.   Cobble—A rock fragment ranging in size from 3 inches to 12 inches. Cobbles may be found disseminated throughout  deposits of cohesionless and cohesive soil or may be concentrated in dense layers.   Core stone—A rock fragment with a maximum edge dimension greater than 12 inches, with no upward limit. Core  stones are masses of rock surrounded by highly weathered to decomposed rock as a result of in-situ weathering.   Cohesionless soil—A soil composed of visible soil particles. Cohesionless soils include non-plastic silt, sand, gravel,  cobbles, and boulders. Shear strength of cohesionless soils is developed from inter-granular friction. Many natural  cohesionless soil deposits have a minor fraction of cohesive soil which adds a cohesion component to shear strength.   Cohesive soil—A soil composed principally of sub-microscopic particles. Cohesive soils generally are characterized  as clays and plastic silts. Electrical charges on the surface of the plate or rod-shaped soil particles develop a shear  strength  component  that  is  known  as  cohesion.  Many  natural  deposits  of  cohesive  soils  have  minor  fractions  of  cohesionless soil.   Fault—A fracture in a rock mass with significant indication of displacement. Fault thickness may range from inches  to hundreds of feet.   Gouge—A zone of finely comminuted soil and rock material often associated with a fault. Gouge material can range  from clay to sand size, but may include cobble or boulder size material in the same gouge zone.   Igneous rock—Rock formed by the cooling and solidification of molten magma. Examples of igneous rocks include  basalt, gabbro, granite, and rhyolite.   Joint—A fracture in the rock mass with minimal indication of displacement. Joints are secondary features that develop  after formation of the rock unit. Joints may be formed by tensile or shear forces caused by cooling of magma, or  folding or faulting of the rock unit.   Lithification—The process for the formation of sedimentary rock from compaction or consolidation of soil under the  weight of overlying material and often accompanied by the deposition of cementing material in the pore space of the  soil.   Metamorphic rock—Rock formed by the alteration of existing rock under conditions of high temperature and high  pressure. Examples of metamorphic rocks include gneiss, phyllite, schist, and slate.   Parting—A thin layer of one type of sedimentary rock embedded within a sedimentary rock unit of different lithology.  Often a weakness plane, such as a shale parting in a sandstone or limestone unit.   Rock—Material  that  is  formed  by  the  lithification  of  soil,  the  cooling  and  solidification  of  molten  magma,  or  the  alteration of existing rocks under conditions of high pressure and high temperature.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Examples of sedimentary rocks include  claystone, conglomerate, dolomite, limestone, mudstone, sandstone, shale, and siltstone.   Shear—A fracture in the rock mass that has an indication of displacement.   Shear  zone—An  area  of  concentrated  shears.  Distance  between  individual  shears  in  a  shear  zone  can  be  highly  variable.   Slickenside—A smooth, polished, and often striated surface on a rock joint or in stiff to hard cohesive soils.   Soil—Natural material derived from the decomposition and weathering of rock. Soil that remains in place at its point  of  formation  is  called  residual  soil.  Soil  that  is  eroded,  transported  away  from  the  location  of  its  formation,  and  deposited at a remote location is called transported soil.   5.3—NOTATION   5.3.1—General   For notation not shown below, refer to the LRFD Specifications.   c  c’  ch  Dr  D  E  Emax   Em    Ei      eo  Gmax  Ja      Jn      Jr      Jv   Jw      kh  Ko  mv  po  ρtot    Q      RQD  SRF   St  su  uo  ν  Vs  σho′   σp′    σ1  σ3  σt  σ’  σc   =  Cohesion (ksf) (C5.5.4)  =  Effective cohesion (ksf) (5.5.2.2) (C5.5.4)  =  Horizontal coefficient of consolidation (C5.4.5)  =  Relative density (C5.4.5)  =  Disturbance factor (C5.5.5)  =  Young’s modulus (ksf) (C5.4.5)  =  Small-strain Young’s modulus (ksf) (C5.4.5)  =  Rock mass deformation modulus (ksf) (C5.5.5)  =  Elastic modulus (ksf) (C5.5.5)  =  In-situ void ratio (C5.4.5)  =  Small-strain shear modulus (ksf) (C5.4.5) (C5.4.6)  Joint alteration number (C5.5.4)  =  Joint set number (C5.5.4)  =  =  Joint roughness number (C5.5.4)  =  Total number of joints per m3 (C5.5.4)  =  =  Horizontal hydraulic conductivity (ft/day) (C5.4.5)  =  Coefficient of at-rest earth pressure (C5.4.5)  =  Volumetric compressibility coefficient (ft2/kip) (C5.4.5)  =  =  Total density (pcf) (C5.4.5)  =  Tunnel Quality Index (C5.5.4) (C5.5.5)  =  Rock Quality Designation (C5.5.4)  =  Stress reduction factor (C5.4.5) (C5.5.4)  =  Soil Sensitivity (C5.4.5)  =  Undrained shear strength (ksf) (C5.4.5)  Initial pore water pressure (ksf) (C5.4.5)  =   Initial mask liftoff pressure (ksf) (C5.4.5)   Joint water number (C5.5.4)       =   Poisson’s ratio (C5.5.6)   In-situ horizontal effective stress (ksf) (C5.4.5)   =  Shear wave velocity (ft/sec) (5.4.6)  =  =  Preconsolidation stress (ksf) (C5.4.5)  =  Major principal stress (ksf) (C5.5.4)  =  Minor principal stress (ksf) (C5.5.4)  =  Tensile strength (point load) (ksf) (C5.5.4)  =  Effective normal stress (ksf) (C5.5.4)  =  Unconfined compressive strength (ksf) (C5.5.4)   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The geotechnical investigation program shall be  developed by a geotechnical engineer knowledgeable of  tunnel  design  and  construction  requirements.  The  geotechnical  investigation  program  shall  be  appropriate  for the project requirements and data needs for planning,  design, and construction.   The  guidelines  included  in  this  article  for  the  geotechnical investigation program shall be considered as  minimum  requirements  and  shall  be  supplemented  with  additional  investigation  and  testing  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  project  and  the  subsurface  conditions  encountered during investigation.   subsurface investigations may provide an economical and  rational approach for adjusting to these deviations.   The  performance  of  a  geotechnical  investigation  program  is  part  of  the  process  of  obtaining  information  relevant  for  the  design  and  construction  of  tunnels.  Examples of unpublished information include subsurface  data and construction records from the tunnel owner, and  from  government  agencies,  utility  owners,  and  private  owners  of  nearby  structures  and  facilities.  Unpublished  information may also be available from individuals with  local experience from previous projects in the vicinity of  the  tunnel,  or  with  tunneling  within  the  same  geologic  formations.    Special  investigation  needs  based  on  tunneling  methods and anticipated geology along the tunnel profile  are  summarized  in  Tables  C5.4.1-1  and  C.5.4.1-2,  respectively.    For  further  information  on  planning  a  geotechnical  investigation program, refer to the Technical Manual for  Design  and  Construction  of  Road  Tunnels—Civil  Elements (AASHTO, 2010), the FHWA reference manual  on  subsurface  investigations  (FHWA,  2002a),  and  the  AASHTO LFRD Bridge Design Specifications (2014).    the  subsurface   At  a  minimum,   investigation  component of the geotechnical investigation shall consist  of borings, Standard Penetration Tests (SPT), undisturbed  sampling  in  cohesive  soils,  double  or  triple  tube  core  barrel  coring  and  packer  testing  in  rock,  groundwater  measurements and Cone Penetration Tests (CPT) within  soil deposits and laboratory testing on recovered soil/rock  samples,  supplemented  with  other  in-situ  soil  and  rock  to  meet  project  requirements.   tests  as  necessary   5.4.2—Office Studies   C5.4.2    Available  materials  relating   to  geological  and  subsurface  conditions  shall  be  reviewed  and  evaluated  prior to developing a boring program for the project.

Borings  for  cut-and-cover  tunnels  and portals shall extend at least 1.5 times the depth of the  portal excavation for design of the support of excavation  (SOE)  system  and  portal  structure  foundations.  This  requirement  may  be  waived  if  the  portal  excavation  extends  into  rock.  In  that  case,  exploration  generally  should  be  advanced  below  the  excavation  invert  until  a  minimum  continuous  core  recovery  of  85%  is  recorded  with rock quality designation (RQD) greater than 50 over  a length of 20 feet.    If  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the  final  profile  of  the tunnel, the borings should extend at least two to three  times  the  tunnel  diameter  below  the  preliminary  tunnel  invert level.    For the most part, field classification of soil for a  tunnel project is similar to that for other geotechnical  applications,  except  that  special  attention  must  be  given  to  accurately  defining  and  documenting  soil  grain  size  characteristics  and  stratification  features.  Items  of  particular  importance  to  tunnel  projects  are  listed below:   •  Groundwater levels (general and perched levels),  evidence  of  ground  permeability  (loss  of  drilling  fluid, rise or drop in borehole water level, etc.), and  evidence of artesian conditions.   •  Consistency and strength of cohesive soils  •  Composition,   gradation,   and   density   of   cohesionless soils   •  Presence  of   lenses  and   layers  of  higher-  permeability soils   •  Presence  of  gravel,  cobbles,  boulders,  and  core  stones,  and  potential  for  nested  boulders  or  concentrated core stones   •  Maximum  cobble/boulder/core  stone  size  from  coring and/or large diameter borings (and based on  the  understanding  of  unconfined  compressive  strength,  abrasiveness,  and  hardness  of  cobbles/boulders/core  stones  (from  field  index  tests  or  laboratory  testing  of  recovered samples)   local  geology)  and   •  Presence of cemented soils  •  Presence of contaminated soil or groundwater   In   rock,   rock  mass  characteristics   (e.g.,  discontinuities) as well as special intact rock properties  are of interest for tunnel projects. In addition to general  rock  lithology  and  discontinuity  descriptions  (e.g.,  predominant joint sets with strike and dip orientations,  joint  roughness, joint  persistence,  joint spacing, joint  weathering,  and  infilling),  other  information  that  should be noted include:   •  Presence of faults or shear zones  •  Presence of intrusive material (volcanic dikes and   sills)   •  Presence  of  voids  (solution  cavities,  lava  tubes,   etc.)   •  Groundwater   levels,  artesian  pressure,  and  evidence  of  rock  permeability  (loss  of  drilling  fluid, rise or drop in borehole water level, etc.)   In  addition  to  vertical  and  inclined  boreholes,  horizontal  boreholes  or  a  pilot  tunnel  along  the  proposed  tunnel  alignment  can  provide  a  continuous  record  of  ground  conditions  and  information  directly  relevant to the tunnel design and excavation.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The in-situ tests usually  used for soils and rock are presented in Tables C5.4.5- 1 and C5.4.5-2.    properties   When  in-situ  test  results  are  used  to  estimate  design  such  through  correlations should be well established through long- detailed  term  widespread  measurements  that  illustrate  the  accuracy  of  the  correlation.   correlations,   thorough   use   or   Often,  CPT  soundings  are  performed  in  soil  to  obtain in-situ test data to complement the data obtained  from  geotechnical  borings  and  laboratory  soil  tests.  CPT soundings are an economical means of providing  a larger number of exploration locations in comparison  to geotechnical borings. In addition, when considered  appropriate by the Project Geotechnical Engineer, CPT  soundings  may  be  used  to  replace  some  of  the  geotechnical  borings,  particularly  at  sites  requiring  a  large number of borings.    In-situ tests may be performed to obtain deformation  and strength parameters for soil and rocks for design and  analysis  purposes.  At  a  minimum,  in-situ  tests  shall  be  conducted  in  soils  that  do  not  lend  themselves  to  undisturbed  sampling  as  a  means  to  estimate  design  parameters.  When  performed,  in-situ  tests  shall  be  conducted in accordance with the appropriate ASTM or  AASHTO standards.   Whenever in-situ tests are performed, several of the  in-situ  to  test  holes  shall  be  performed  adjacent  geotechnical borings to assist in the interpretation of soil  classifications  at  other  in-situ  test  locations,  and  to  provide  correlations  between  in-situ  test  data  and  laboratory test results.    A soil/rock sampling program shall be developed to  obtain  necessary  information  for  planning,  design,  and  construction of the tunnel.   5.4.5.1—Soil Sampling   The overburden soil shall be sampled at intervals not  greater  than  five  feet  and  at  changes  in  strata  using  a  Standard  Split  Spoon  Sampler  (ASTM  D1586).  In  addition,  undisturbed  tube  samples  from  cohesive  soil  strata shall be collected at intervals not exceeding 15 ft.  For bored and mined tunnels, continuous sampling from  one  diameter  above  the  tunnel  crown  to  1.5  diameters  below the tunnel invert shall be performed.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Common  practice is to photograph the rock cores in core boxes  and  possibly  scan  the  core  samples  for  review  by  designers and contractors.   Drilling  through  a  significant  depth  of  soil  and  rock above the tunnel horizon using conventional soil  sampling  techniques  and  rock  coring  is  a  significant  expense that may yield limited useful information for  deep  tunnels. In  such  cases, an  economical  approach  may be to limit soil sampling and rock coring to zones  within  and  near  the  tunnel  horizon.  The  limits  of  sampling  and  coring  should  be  determined  by  a  geotechnical  engineer  who  is  knowledgeable  of  tunneling  and  the  geologic  formations  within  the  project site.   Continuous  rock  core  generally  shall  be  obtained  below the surface of rock, with a minimum core diameter  of NX-size (diameter of 2.16 in.).    At  the  discretion  of  the  Project  Geotechnical  Engineer,  based  on  their  evaluation  of  project  geology,  the  continuous  rock  coring  requirement  may  be  waived  for  very  deep holes.  In  that situation,  coring  may  begin  two to three tunnel diameters (widths) above the crown of  the tunnel. The boring may be advanced by rotary drilling  methods  from  the  ground  surface  to  the  start  of  coring  operations.  A  post-completion  ATV  survey  may  be  desirable in this situation if the geologic environment is  complex.    Double  or  triple  tube  core  barrels  shall  be  used  to  obtain  high  quality  cores  representative  of  the  in-situ  rock. For deeper holes, coring shall be performed with the  use  of  wire-line  drilling  equipment  to  further  reduce  potential degradation of the recovered core samples. Core  runs  shall  be  limited  to  a  maximum  length  of  10  ft  in  moderate  to  good  quality  rock,  and  5  ft  in  poor  quality  rock.   5.4.5.3—Bore Hole Sealing   All borings shall be sealed at the completion of the  subsurface  investigation,  if  not  intended  to  be  used  as  monitoring wells. Sealing of the borings shall be done in  a  manner  that  will  not  be  detrimental  to  the  anticipated  tunnel construction methodology.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

A short segment of  the hole is sealed off using a straddle packer. This is followed by pressurization  by pumping in water. The pressure is raised until the rock surrounding the hole  fails  in  tension  at  a  critical  pressure.  Following  hydraulic  fracturing  of  the  rock, the applied test pressure at which the hydrofracture closes completely  estimates the in situ stress acting normal to the hydrofracture In a vertical test  hole, the hydrofractures are expected to be formed vertical and perpendicular  to the minimum horizontal stress. Interpretation of hydrofracturing tests can  be difficult at depths less than 150 feet below ground surface.  Overcoring drills a small diameter borehole and sets an instrument to respond  to changes in diameter into it. Rock stresses are determined indirectly from  measurements of the dimensional changes of the borehole, occurring when the  rock volume surrounding the hole is isolated from the stresses in the host rock.  Maintaining correct drill hole orientation is of critical importance.  This method involves the use of flat hydraulic jacks, con.sting of two plates of  steel  welded  around  their  edges  and  a  nipple  for  introducing  oil  into  the  intervening space. The flat jack is inserted into the slot, cemented in place, and  pressurized.  When  the  pins  have  been  returned  to  the  initial  separation,  the  pressure in the jack approximates the initial stress normal to the jack. Usually  performed  in  an  exploratory  tunnel/adit.  Disturbance  of  stress  field  around  exploratory tunnel/adit is a concern.   A relatively flat rock surface is sculpted and leveled with mortar to receive  circular bearing plates 20 to 40 in. in diameter. The rock surface is loaded and  the  resulting  displacement  is  monitored.  This  is  easily  arranged  in  an  exploratory tunnel/adit. The site should be selected carefully to exclude loose,  highly fractured rock.   The test is a borehole expansion experiment conducted with a rubber sleeve.  The expansion of the borehole is measured by the oil or gas flow into the sleeve  as the pressure is raised, or by potentiometers or linear variable differential  transformers  built  inside  the  sleeve.  One  problem  with  the  borehole  dilatometer test is that it affects a relatively small volume of rock and therefore  contains an incomplete sample of the fracture system.  This method involves the use of flat hydraulic jacks, consisting of two plates  of  steel welded  around  their  edges  and  a nipple  for  introducing  oil  into  the  intervening  space.  Provide  measurement  points  on  the  face  of  the  rock  and  deep slot (reference points). Modulus of deformation can be calculated from  the measured pin displacements.   Radial Jacking  Test   Loads are applied to the circumference of a tunnel by a series of jacks reacting  against circular steel ring members. This test allows the direction of load to be  varied according to the plan for pressuring the jacks.   Pressuremeter    The pressure required to expand the cylindrical membrane to a certain volume  or radial strain is recorded in a borehole. It is applicable for soft rocks.

The wave velocity can  be measured by swinging a sledgehammer against an outcrop and observing  the travel time to a geophone standing on the rock at a distance of up to about  150 ft. The stress loadings sent through the rock by this method are small and  transient.  Most  rock  masses  depart  significantly  from  the  ideal  materials;  consequently,  elastic  properties  calculated  from  these  equations  are  often  considerably larger than elastic properties calculated from static loading tests,  particularly in the case of fractured rocks.  ATV produces images of the borehole wall based on the amplitude and travel  time  of  acoustic  signals  reflected  from  the  borehole  wall.  A  portion  of  the  reflected  energy  is  lost  in  voids  or  fractures,  producing  dark  bands  on  the  amplitude log. Travel time measurements allow reconstruction of the borehole  shape, making it possible to generate a 3-D representation of a borehole.  The Borehole Video System (BVS) is lowered down boreholes to inspect the  geology  and  structural  integrity.  The  camera  view  of fractures  and voids  in  boreholes provides information.  Slug tests are applicable to a wide range of geologic settings as well as small- diameter piezometers or observation wells, and in areas of low permeability  where it would be difficult to conduct a pumping test. A slug test is performed  by injecting or withdrawing a known volume of water or air from a well and  measuring the aquifer’s response by the rate at which the water level returns  to equilibrium. Permeability values derived relate primarily to the horizontal  conductivity. Slug tests have a much smaller zone of infiltration than pumping  tests, and thus are only reliable at a much smaller scale.  The  test  is  conducted  by  pumping  water  at  a  constant  pressure  into  a  test  section of a borehole and measuring the flow rate. Borehole test sections are  sealed off by packers, with the use of one or two packers being the most widely  used techniques. The test is rapid and simple to conduct, and by performing  tests  within  intervals  along  the  entire  length  of  a  borehole,  a  permeability  profile can be obtained. The limitation of the test is that it affects a relatively  small  volume  of  the  surrounding  medium,  because  frictional  losses  in  the  immediate vicinity of the test section are normally extremely large.    In a pumping test, water is pumped from a well normally at a constant rate  over a certain time period, and the drawdown of the water table or piezometric  head is measured in the well and in piezometers or observation wells in the  vicinity.  Since  pumping  tests  involve  large  volumes  of  the  rock  mass,  they  have  the  advantage  of  averaging  the  effects  of  the  inherent  discontinuities.  Most classical solutions for pump test data are based on the assumptions that  the aquifers are homogeneous and isotropic, and that the flow is governed by  Darcy\\'s Law. The major disadvantage is the period of time required to perform  a test. Test durations of one week or longer are not unusual when attempting  to  approach  steady-state  flow  conditions.  Additionally,  large  diameter  boreholes  or  wells  are  required  since  the  majority  of  the  conditions  encountered require the use of a downhole pump.    5.4.6—Geophysical Tests   C5.4.6   Geophysical  tests  shall  be  used  only  in  combination  with  information  from  direct  methods  of  exploration  to  establish  location  and  identification  of  the  subsurface  materials,  the  profile  of  the  top  of  bedrock  and  bedrock    Application of geophysical testing methods and  other  relevant  information  regarding  subsurface  investigation  for  highway  tunnels  are  presented  in  Tables C5.4.6-1 and C5.4.6-2.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Laboratory  tests  shall  be  used  in  conjunction  with  field  tests  and  field  characterization  of  the  rock  mass  to  give  estimates  of  rock  mass  behavioral  characteristics.   Standard  rock  tests  used  to  evaluate  physical  properties  of  the  rock  include  density  and  mineralogy  tests (thin-section analysis). The mechanical properties  of  the  intact  rock  core  include  uniaxial  compressive  strength,  tensile  strength,  static  and  dynamic  elastic  constants, hardness, and abrasiveness indices.

Related considerations include the potential impact  of groundwater lowering on settlement of overlying and  nearby  structures,  utilities,  and  other  facilities;  other  influences  of  dewatering  on  existing  structures  (e.g.,  accelerated  deterioration  of  exposed  timber  piles);  pumping  construction;  volumes  for  water  decontamination/treatment  measures  discharged from pumping; migration of existing soil and  groundwater  contaminants  due  to  dewatering;  the  potential impact on water supply aquifers; and seepage  into the completed tunnel.   during   Borehole permeability tests in general provide low  cost  means  for  assessing  the  permeability  of  soil  and  rock but may provide information for a limited zone near  the test location. Continuous pumping tests, on the other  hand, may provide information over an extended area.  Further information regarding the details and procedures  used for performing and evaluation of these field tests  are provided by Mayne et al. (FHWA, 2002a).   If  there  is  a  hydraulic  connection  between  the  surface  water  body  and  the  tunnel,  high  initial  water  inflows  and  reduced  sustained  inflows  may  be  encountered that may damage equipment and require the  implementation  of  extensive  water  inflow  control  measures.   Although  not  common,  drainage  of  surface  water  bodies into tunnels has been reported with high volume  initial  flows  and  reduced  sustained  flows.  These  incidents  have  sometimes  led  to  the  temporary  or  permanent drying up of small streams and ponds and to  significant delays in tunnel construction.   5.5—SELECTION OF SOIL AND ROCK  PARAMETERS FOR DESIGN   5.5.1—General   The  soil  and  rock  design  parameters  shall  be  determined using one or more of the following methods:  subsurface  during  investigation,  including  consideration  of  any  geophysical testing conducted;   •  In-situ   testing   the   •  Laboratory testing; and/or  •  Back analysis of design parameters based on site   performance data.

The  selected  design  parameters  shall  be  appropriate  to  the  particular  limit  state under consideration and the corresponding analysis  model.   The evaluation of design parameters for rock shall  take  into  consideration  that  rock  mass  properties  are  generally  controlled  by  the  discontinuities  within  the  rock  mass  and  not  the  intact  material  properties.  A  combination  of  laboratory  testing  of  small  samples,  empirical  analysis,  and  field  observations  shall  be  employed  to  determine  the  design  parameters  for  the  rock  mass,  with  greater  emphasis  placed  on  visual  observations  and  quantitative  descriptions  of  the  rock  mass.   5.5.2—Soil Strength   C5.5.2   The selection of soil strength parameters for design   shall consider the following at a minimum:   •  Rate  of  construction  loading  relative  to  the  hydraulic conductivity of the soil (drained versus  undrained strengths);    •  Loading direction;  •  Strain levels; and  •  Effect of the construction sequence.   5.5.2.1—Undrained Shear Strength of Cohesive Soils   For additional information, see Article C10.4.6.2.1  of  the  LRFD  Specifications  and  FHWA  Geotechnical  Engineering  Circular  No.  5—Evaluation  of  Soil  and  Rock Properties, 2002.   shear   the  undrained   Generally, laboratory consolidated undrained (CU)  and unconsolidated undrained (UU) testing shall be used  strength,  Su,  to  estimate  supplemented  as  needed  with  values  determined  from  in-situ testing.

In  laboratory  tests,  the  rate  of  loading  shall  be  sufficiently  slow  to  ensure substantially complete dissipation of excess pore  pressure  in  the  drained  tests,  or  in  undrained  tests,  complete  equalization  of  pore  pressure  throughout  specimen.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Mechanical or hand excavation in poor quality rock masses (no blasting) results in  minimal disturbance to the surrounding rock mass.   D = 0   D = 0   Where  squeezing  problems  result  in  significant  floor  heave,  disturbance  can  be  severe unless a temporary invert is placed.    D = 0.5  No invert   Very  poor  quality  blasting  in  a  hard  rock  tunnel  results  in  severe  local  damage,  extending 6 to 9 ft, in the surrounding rock mass.   D = 0.8   Small scale blasting in civil engineering slopes results in modest rock mass damage,  particularly  if  controlled  blasting  is  used.  However,  stress  relief  results  in  some  disturbance.   Very  large  open  pit  mine  slopes  suffer  significant  disturbance  due  to  heavy  production blasting and also due to stress relief from overburden removal.   D = 0.7  Good blasting   D = 1.0  Poor blasting  D = 1.0  Production blasting   In some softer rocks, excavation can be carried out by ripping and dozing, and the  degree of damage to the slope is less.

Shallow  depth  vehicular  tunnels  are  usually  designed as cut-and-cover tunnels. For invert depths up  to  60  feet  below  grade,  this  method  is  often  less  expensive and more practical than tunneling. Cut-and- cover vehicular tunnels are also used at the approaches  to mined, bored, and immersed tunnels.    The  ground  surrounding  a  tunnel  can  act  as  a  supporting  mechanism,  loading  mechanism,  or  both,  depending on the nature of the ground, the tunnel size,  and the method and sequence of constructing the tunnel.  Thus,  the  rock  or  soil  surrounding  a  tunnel  is  a  construction material.   The  provisions  of  this  Section  shall  apply  to  the  planning,  design,  evaluation,  and rehabilitation of  cut- and-cover highway tunnels, and the permanent support  of excavation (SOE) systems that are incorporated into  tunnels  may  be  the  final  constructed  in  place  or  formed  of  precast  sections.  Temporary  SOE  and  temporary  slopes  for  open  excavations are not included in this Section.   tunnel  structure.  The   Cut-and-cover  tunnels  and  their  components  shall  be designed to sustain the most severe combination of  loads  to  which  they  may  be  subjected  both  during  construction  and  after  the  final  stage  when  the  construction is complete and the tunnel is in service.    Effects  of  erection,  bracing,  excavation  sequence,  and other temporary loads during the construction shall  be considered in the design of cut-and-cover tunnels and  their  components.  A  structural  system  study  shall  be  prepared  to  determine  the  most  suitable  structural  alternatives for construction of the cut-and-cover tunnel.  This study shall include a determination of the proposed  tunnel section, the excavation support system, the tunnel  structural system, the construction method (top-down or  bottom-up), and the waterproofing system.  When an open cut with stable sloped sides for the earth  being  excavated  is  not  practical,  an  SOE  system  (shoring system) shall be used to stabilize the ground.  Permanent SOE systems may be used as part of the final  structure if they are designed and detailed accordingly.   Refer  to  Section  3  for  load  factors  and  load  combinations that shall be considered during the design  of cut-and-cover tunnels.   Refer  to  Section  4  for  material  properties  and  resistance  factors  that  shall  be  considered  during  the  design of cut-and-cover tunnels.   Refer  to  Section  10  for  seismic  considerations   during the design of cut and cover tunnels.    Cut-and-cover tunnel structures shall be designed in  accordance  with  AASHTO  LRFD  Bridge  Design  Specifications  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  LFRD  Specifications) including all applicable interim changes,  except as modified or supplemented here.   6.2—DEFINITIONS   Reinforced Concrete Diaphragm Wall—Slurry wall designed to span vertically with no structural continuity between  panels.

The  need  for  mitigating  measures  such  as  ground  improvement  shall  be  investigated.  See  Section 9 for ground improvement.   If  cut  slopes  are  used  in  lieu  of  SOE  structures,  the  stability  of  the  cut  slopes  in  soil  and/or  rock,  groundwater  conditions and the base of excavation shall be investigated to  ensure a stable, dry open excavation.   be  performed  to  determine  the  most  economical  approach to stabilizing the open excavation.   The  Contractor  is  responsible  for  the  final  selection and proper execution of measures to maintain  stability  of  the  open  excavation  during  construction  when the stability is maintained by temporary means.    6.4.1.3—Envelope Ground   C6.2.1.3   The earth and groundwater pressures shall be calculated  in accordance with the provisions of Section 3. The modulus  of  subgrade  reaction  may  be  calculated  using  conventional  soil mechanics used in the design of walls and foundations.  Other  pertinent  ground  properties  shall  be  determined  in  accordance with the provisions of Section 5.   Cut-and-cover  tunnels  may  be  designed  by  applying  external loads to a structural model or may be analyzed taking  into account the effects of soil–structure interaction.   The  characteristics  of  the  ground  around  a  cut- and-cover  tunnel  determine  how  far  the  structural  walls and invert slab can deflect into the surrounding  ground,  how  much  pressure  the  ground  and  groundwater will exert on the structural wall over time,  and  the  effects  of  loadings  from  adjacent  existing  infrastructure.    6.4.1.4—Groundwater   C6.4.1.4   Control  of  groundwater   is  required  during   construction by cut-and-cover methods to:  •  Permit excavation in the dry.  •  Prevent   the  migration  of  groundwater  contaminants,  frequently  found  in  urban  areas.   •  Minimize disturbance, heave, or softening of  the excavated base and to prevent flow of the  materials  (piping)  through  the  excavation  walls and excavation invert.   •  Reduce water pressure acting on the support   system during the construction.    Design  and  execution  of  protection  of  the  excavation  from  flooding  during  construction  is  the  responsibility of the Contractor.   In  addition  to  subsurface  investigations  included  in  Section  5  for groundwater  considerations  during  the  design  and  construction  of  cut-and-cover  tunnels,  pre-construction  exploration shall take into account the information needed to  develop a water control plan.    The effect of the hydrostatic pressure shall be considered  whenever  the  groundwater  table  is  detected  within  the  construction envelope or may be reasonably expected to occur  within the envelope over time.    Groundwater  levels  to  be  used  for  the  design  shall  be   established in accordance with Sections 3 and 5.    Long-term  variations  in  the  groundwater  level  shall  be  considered in establishing the design groundwater elevation.  Flood  conditions  with  500-year  return  period  shall  be  investigated during the design and shall be evaluated as the  extreme load case during the design phase.   Measures shall be taken to control groundwater entering  the excavation area during construction, either by creating an  impervious SOE wall (e.g., slurry or secant pile walls) or by  allowing water to seep through pervious walls, collecting it in  sump areas and pumping it out. When pervious SOE walls are  used, the potential for soil erosion (piping), and unacceptable  settlement of nearby structures, roadways, and utilities due to  consolidation of compressible strata shall be considered in the  design. Discharge of water collected in excavations shall be  subject to all applicable laws and regulations.    Drawing down the local groundwater table through the  use  of  wells  shall  consider  the  potential  for  settlement  of  surrounding  soils  and  the  effects  of  settlement  on  adjacent  existing structures and infrastructure.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Set-time and slump shall be considered  during design of concrete mixes as they pertain to the means  and methods of concrete placement which will vary with the  Contractor’s equipment and sequence.   The  chemistry  of  the  groundwater  shall  be  considered   when designing the concrete mix.   Air entrainment of three to five percent is recommended  for  the  durability  of  the  concrete  in  moist  and  cold  environments.    Often thick elements are required to support loads or to  resistance  against  uplift.  Mix  designs  and  provide  specifications appropriate to mass concrete may be required.  Refer also to Section 4 for concrete material properties.    Cast-in-place  concrete  is  commonly  used  to  construct  cut-and-cover  tunnels  due  to  the  ease  with  which large members can be constructed in restricted  work  space.  The  weight  of  the  concrete  resists  buoyancy; concrete can be detailed to be fairly water-  tight, and it is resistant to fire and corrosion. However,  other  materials  such  as  precast,  prestressed  concrete,  post-tensioned concrete, and precast concrete are also  used  for  construction  of  cut-and-cover  tunnels.  The  selection of materials is based on construction method  and is generally done early in the planning stages.   Refer  to  AASHTO’s  Technical  Manual  for  Design  of  Road  Tunnels—Civil  Elements  for  more  details.   6.4.2.2—Structural Steel   C6.4.2.2    When used, measures shall be provided to protect steel  members  from  corrosion  and  heat  from  fire  events.  The  design  life  of  the  structure  shall  be  considered  when  developing corrosion protection measures.   Refer  also  to  Section  4  for  structural  steel  material   properties.     Structural  steel  framing  is  not  as  commonly  used  now as it was early in the last century, due primarily to  the difficulties associated with corrosion protection for  the  structural  steel.  However,  composite  designs  can  be  used  to  reduce  the  thickness  of  members  where  space is constricted. Careful attention to waterproofing  and  corrosion  protection  is  required  for  durable  facilities.    6.4.2.3—Reinforcing Steel   Reinforcing  steel  shall  conform  to  requirements  of  ASTM A615 grade 60 unless corrosive environments call for  the  use  of  galvanized,  epoxy-coated,  or  stainless  steel  reinforcement. If reinforcement is to be welded, or if ductility  for  seismic  capacity  is  required,  ASTM  A706  shall  be  specified.   Refer  also  to  Section  4  for  reinforcing  steel  material   properties.   6.4.2.4—Prestressing Steel   C6.4.2.4   Prestressing steel shall be bonded and protected against  corrosion, with attention to combating the effects of corrosive  compounds  in  the  surrounding  soils  or  groundwater.  Bond  capacity  shall  be  tested  in  accordance  with  ASTM  A981.  Strand shall conform to ASTM A416, and bars shall conform  to  ASTM  A722.  The  Engineer  shall  include  relaxation  requirements in the project specifications.   Refer  also  to  Section  4  for  prestressing  steel  material   properties.    precast   elements   Some jurisdictions prohibit the use of prestressed  elements  below  grade  because  of  concerns  about  corrosion.  However,  with  appropriate  protection,  prestressed,  streamline  construction. Prestressed, precast elements have been  used to form roofs of shallow buried structures, with  thin cast-in-place slabs placed over the top to provide  a  diaphragm.  Prestressed  steel  is  commonly  used for  permanent  rock  anchors,  with  protection  against  corrosion provided by corrosion-inhibiting compounds  (resins  and  greases),  sleeves,  and  grout.

Refer to Section 4 for shotcrete material properties.   Shotcrete  is  frequently  used  as  a  smoothing  layer  between  excavated  rock  faces,  slurry,  secant,  and  tangent  pile  walls  and  waterproofing  membranes  in  cut-and-cover construction. It has also had limited use  as  a  replacement  for  cast-in-place  walls  to  save  the  costs  and  schedule  associated  with  erection  and  removal of formwork.    When shotcrete is used to replace concrete in the  final structure, it will be applied in layers with a time  lag  between  the  applications.  To  ensure  that  the  behavior  is  identical  to  monolithic  concrete,  it  is  essential to limit the time lag between the applications.  It  is  recommended  that  a  bonding  agent  be  used  between layers.    The surface of the shotcrete shall be clean and free  of  any  dust  or  dirt  that  might  create  a  debonding  between individual layers.   Shotcrete shall not be considered as a barrier to  the  movement  of  water  over  the  long  term,  i.e.  shotcrete  shall  not  be  used  as  a  waterproofing  membrane.   6.5—CONSTRUCTION OF CUT-AND-COVER   TUNNEL STRUCTURES   6.5.1—General    C6.5.1   Excavations shall be supported by wall systems laterally  temporary  or  supported  by  temporary  bracing  and/or  permanent tiebacks, unless the excavation is sloped back to  eliminate the need for structural support. These systems shall  also minimize ground movements adjacent to the excavation,  and  other  to  protect  adjacent  utilities,  buildings,  infrastructure.  Where  required,  excavation  support  systems  shall be designed to prevent or limit groundwater drawdown  outside the excavation limits. SOE systems may be temporary  or permanent.    Temporary  SOE  systems  shall  be  designed  by  the  Contractor and removed or abandoned in place, as required  by  permitting  authorities.  The  drawings  shall  show  the  following information:   •  Space for the temporary SOE system.  •  Restrictions on the temporary SOE system.   Cut-and-cover   tunnels  are  built   inside  an  excavation  and  covered  over  with  backfill  material  when the tunnel structure is completed. This method is  used  when  the  tunnel  profile  is  not  deep,  making  the  surface  both  possible  and  excavation  from  economical.   Cut-and-cover   construction  methodologies  include  top-down  and  bottom-up  construction.  The  construction  methodology  must  be  considered  when  developing designs and details.   When the construction area is limited and an open  sloped excavation is not possible, a system to support  the  excavation  is  necessary  to  create  space  for  the  construction.    Groundwater  drawdown  can  result  in  unwanted  that  affect  adjacent  existing  ground  settlements  infrastructure,  migration  in  groundwater,  and  the  need  for  disposal  of  the  groundwater entering the excavation.    contaminates   of   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Flexible  SOE  systems  include  sheet  piling,  and   soldier pile and lagging walls.   Semi-rigid  SOE  systems   include  reinforced  concrete  diaphragm  slurry  walls,  soldier  pile  and  tremie  concrete  (SPTC)  walls,  secant  pile  walls,  tangent pile walls, and precast, prestressed panel walls.  The sequence of construction may be bottom-up,  where  the  excavation  is  completed  first,  then  the  structure  is  built  from  the  bottom  up  or  it  may  be  constructed  from  the  top  down,  where  a  deck  is  constructed over the top, for example to allow traffic  over  the  work  site,  and  excavation  and  construction  proceed sequentially downward.   •  Design load criteria for the temporary SOE system.  •  Limits  on  the  vertical  and  horizontal  spacing  of   bracing or anchor elements.   Permanent SOE systems are defined as those that serve  both  as  temporary  support  and  as  part  of  the  permanent  structure. Additional mitigation measures, such as an interior  cavity  wall  drainage  system  or  impervious  architectural  facing  wall,  may  be  required  since  seepage  through the permanent excavation support system can occur  because  the  exterior  of  the  support  walls  cannot  be  waterproofed.  Cavity  wall  drainage  systems  shall  include  a  collection  system  and  pumps  for  discharging  the  collected  water.   interior   SOE systems shall be classified as flexible or semi-rigid.   Flexible systems shall be considered temporary systems  and  shall  not  be  incorporated  into  the  permanent  structure.  The design of these wall systems is not within the scope of  these Specifications.   Semi-rigid systems may be designed to be incorporated  into the permanent structure. When designed to be part of the  permanent  structure,  these  wall  types  shall  be  designed  in  accordance with these Specifications.   The design and detailing of the SOE shall consider the  sequence  of  installation  and  account  for  the  changes  in  loading  conditions  and  deflections  that  occur  as  excavation  proceeds,  and  the  anchor  or  bracing  system  is  installed.  If  anchors or bracing are not required, the deflection that occurs  as excavation proceeds shall be accounted for.   The design shall be checked for an assumed sequence of  construction  by  the  Engineer.  The  assumed  sequence  of  construction shall be shown on the drawings. Constraints that  would  affect  alternate  sequences  of  construction  shall  be  described in the contract documents.   When an alternative sequence of construction is allowed  by  the  contract  documents  and  proposed  by  the  Contractor,  the  Contractor  shall  verify  that  the  design  as  shown  on  the  drawings  can  adequately  support  the  loads  imposed  by  all  stages  of  the  construction.  If  the  proposed  sequence  of  construction creates load and deflection effects that cannot be  supported  by  the  design  shown  on  the  drawings,  the  Contractor shall develop and construct designs in accordance  with this Specification that can adequately support the loads  and  result  in  deflections  that  are  not  detrimental  to  the  structure or surrounding existing infrastructure.    Deflections of walls and other structural systems that are  incorporated  into  the  final  structure  shall  be  investigated  in  conjunction  with  potential  settlement  of  earth  behind  the  walls. Deflections shall be limited to values that do not cause  structures  and  unacceptable  movement  of  existing  infrastructure,  or  cause  impacts  to  the  performance  and  durability of the permanent wall.   6.5.2—Reinforced Concrete Diaphragm Walls (RCDWs)   C6.5.2   Reinforced concrete diaphragm walls (RCDWs) shall be  designed  to  support  vertical,  or  near  vertical,  faces  of  the  excavation in areas of  soil and decomposed rock below the  water table. RCDWs may be designed to be incorporated into  the permanent structure or may be used as temporary  SOE.   Reinforced  concrete  diaphragm  walls  are  constructed  by  excavating  a  trench  to  the  thickness  required for the external structural wall of the cut-and- cover tunnel and to the depth required for geotechnical  and structural requirements.

The invert slab shall be anchored to the wall to transfer  all the force effects from the wall to the base slab and vice  versa.  Connection  details  shall  be  such  that  they  provide  a  watertight  connection.  Lateral  earth  pressure  and  water  pressure  for  reinforced  concrete  diaphragm  walls  shall  be  calculated in accordance with Section 3.   The following are design requirements for RCDWs:  •  RCDWs  shall  be  designed  to  span  vertically  between  temporary  support   lateral  supporting  systems  for  conditions encountered during construction.   •  RCDWs shall be designed for the final location of roof,  invert, and intermediate horizontal structural elements.  •  The  Engineer  shall  establish  a  workable  temporary  bracing scheme and check the walls for that scheme. The  temporary  bracing  scheme  and  assumptions  associated  therewith, including the design loads, shall be included  in the contract documents.    •  Supplemental reinforcement may be required to serve as  internal  walers  or  to  distribute  forces  around  inserts  or  openings.   •  Minimum  cover  protection  for  the  reinforcement  steel  shall be 3 in. for the face of the wall permanently exposed  to the earth.   •  Detailed  analyses  shall  be  performed  to  evaluate  wall  deflection at each stage of construction and the possible  ground movement and adjacent ground settlement due to  the  wall  deflection,  and  its  effect  on  adjacent  existing  construction.   •  The  design  shall  include  removable  block-outs  for  structural  connections  between  the  wall  and  slabs  or  other permanent structural features.   The  design  shall  account  for  construction  tolerances  in  the  excavation  of  the  slurry  panels  and  placement  of  the  reinforcement  cage.  Typical  vertical  construction  tolerance  for the excavation of the slurry panels is one percent in the  vertical direction. Typical reinforcement steel cage placement  tolerances  are  1  in.  horizontally  (not  including  the  vertical  slurry panel construction tolerance) and 12 in. vertically.   filling  it  with  dense  slurry  of  bentonite  or  other  naturally  occurring  clays  as  it  is  excavated.  For  this  reason, diaphragm walls are also referred to as slurry  walls. Polymer slurries have been used for diaphragm  wall  construction  with  variable  success.  Considering  the geometry of the excavated panels and the superior  performance  of  mineral  slurries,  the  use  of  mineral  slurry should generally be specified.   The trench will typically extend for some distance  below the bottom of the tunnel structure for stability  and  as  needed  for  water  cutoff  during  construction.  Reinforcing  steel  is  lowered  into  the  slurry-filled  trench.  Concrete  is  then  placed  in  the  trench  using  tremie pipes, with placement starting from the bottom  and proceeding upward, with the concrete displacing  the slurry. Once the concrete has cured, excavation for  the tunnel construction may begin.   The  walls  are  constructed  in  panels,  which  are  typically between 5 ft and 20 ft in length. The panel  layout  is  dictated  by  the  geometry  of  the  structure,  ground conditions, and site restrictions. The panels are  constructed  in  an  alternating  checker  board  pattern.  Primary  panels  are  constructed  first,  skipping  over  adjacent  panels.  Secondary  panels  are  constructed  between the completed primary panels to complete the  wall.    For   top-down  construction,  excavation   is  performed to the depth of the bottom of the roof slab.  The tunnel roof slab is constructed on-grade and tied  into  the  diaphragm  wall.  The  tunnel  roof  braces  the  diaphragm wall against lateral movement. Depending  on the depth of the tunnel, the roof could be the first  level  of  bracing  or  an  intermediate  level,  with  temporary  bracing  levels  above  and  below  it.  The  excavation then continues downward, with additional  bracing or floors constructed as needed. At the bottom  of the excavation, the tunnel invert slab is cast and tied  into the walls.   For  bottom-up  construction,  as  the  excavation  proceeds, intermediate temporary braces are installed,  often  at  multiple  levels.  Once  the  required  depth  is  reached, the construction of the permanent invert slab  and  any  intermediate  levels  will  follow  from  the  bottom  to  the  top.  Once  the  tunnel  roof  is  cast,  the  trench is backfilled, and the surface restored.   6.5.3—Soldier Pile and Tremie Concrete (SPTC) Walls   C6.5.3   Soldier pile and tremie concrete (SPTC) walls shall be  constructed  using  vertical  wide  flange  or  built-up  steel  members  placed  at  the  ends  of  excavated  slurry  panels.  Concrete is placed between the soldier piles. The soldier piles  shall  be  designed  to  span  vertically  to  resist  the  loads  transferred by the reinforced concrete spanning horizontally  between them.    SPTC walls are constructed in the same sequence  as  reinforced  concrete  diaphragm  walls.  However,  once  the  primary  panel  is  excavated,  vertical  wide  flange  steel  beams  or  girders  are  lowered  into  the  panels, one at each end of the primary panels, followed  by  reinforcing  steel  cages,  if  required.  Secondary  panels are excavated and constructed between the steel    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  All rights reserved.

Reinforcing  steel when required is placed into the secondary panel.  The slurry used to hold the excavated secondary panel  open  is  displaced  by  structural  concrete  placed  via  tremie pipes from the bottom of the panel. SPTC walls  provide  a  relatively  watertight  wall  and  significant  strength  in  the  vertical  direction.  They  allow  greater  flexibility  in  detailing  connections  to  permanent  horizontal members than is allowed by the use of rebar  couplers in diaphragm walls. Careful attention must be  paid to waterproofing and corrosion protection of the  structural steel members and connections.   The following are design requirements for SPTC walls:  •  Steel  piles  shall  be  designed  to  span  vertically  and  to  resist all temporary, construction, and final loads.  •  Assumed  excavation  and  construction  sequence  for  the  design of walls shall be explicitly and clearly shown on  the contract drawings, including all bracing assumptions  and design loads.    •  Effect of removal of the internal bracing during the final  phase  of  the  construction  of  the  cut-and-cover  tunnels  shall be investigated during the design.   •  Minimum  cover  protection  for  the  reinforcement  steel  shall be 3 in. for the face of the wall permanently exposed  to the earth.   •  Detailed  analyses  shall  be  performed  to  evaluate  wall  deflection at each stage of construction and the possible  ground movement and adjacent ground settlement due to  the  wall  deflection  and  its  effect  on  adjacent  existing  construction.   •  The  design  shall  include  removable  block-outs  for  structural  connections  between  the  wall  and  slabs  or  other permanent structural features.   The  design  shall  account  for  construction  tolerances  in  the excavation of the slurry panels and placement of the steel  members  and  reinforcement  cage.  Typical  vertical  construction tolerance for the excavation of the slurry panels  is one percent in the vertical direction. Typical reinforcement  steel  cage  placement  tolerances  are  1  in.  horizontally  (not  including the vertical panel construction tolerance) and 12 in.  vertically.   6.5.4—Secant Pile and Tangent Pile Walls   C6.5.4   Secant  pile  and  tangent pile  walls  shall  be constructed  using  vertical  drilled  shafts.  The  drilled  shafts  shall  be  reinforced  with  deformed  reinforcing  steel  bars  or  with  a  structural steel core fabricated from rolled shapes or built-up  plate  members  and  backfilled  with  structural  concrete.  Reinforcement is commonly placed in alternate secant piles  and  every  tangent  pile.  If  required,  steel  sections  can  be  placed in every secant pile taking care to avoid interference  during  installation  of  secondary  piles.  Structural  concrete  shall be used to backfill the shafts after placement of the steel  sections. The drilled shafts constructed either adjacent to or  touching each other (tangent pile walls) or the drilled shafts  shall have some overlap with each other (secant pile walls).  The reinforced shafts or the shafts containing steel cores shall  be designed to span vertically to resist the loads transferred  by the unreinforced concrete shafts between them.   The  following  are  design  requirements  for  secant  pile   and tangent pile walls:  •  Reinforced concrete or steel core piles shall be designed  temporary,   resist  all   to   to  span  vertically  and  construction, and final loads.   •  Assumed  excavation  and  construction  sequence  for  the  design of walls shall be explicitly and clearly shown on  the contract drawings, including all bracing assumptions.    Secant pile and tangent pile walls are constructed  in a similar manner. Every other pile (primary piles) is  constructed first. The remaining piles (secondary piles)  are constructed next. Either slurry or steel casings are  used  to  support  the  excavation  when  required  by  ground  conditions.  Concrete  is  placed  into  the  shaft  utilizing  tremie  pipes.  When  used,  the  slurry  is  displaced  by  concrete  placed  from  the  bottom  of  the  shaft.  Steel  casings  are  extracted  as  the  concrete  is  placed, keeping a minimum  amount of casing within  the plastic concrete as the casing is extracted.   Secant  pile  and  tangent  pile  walls  exhibit  good  strength  in  the  vertical  direction.  They  allow  greater  flexibility  in  detailing  connections  to  permanent  horizontal members (when steel cores are used) than is  allowed  by  the  use  of  rebar  couplers  in  reinforced  concrete  piles.  Construction  tolerances  can  result  in  large gaps between piles in both the longitudinal and  transverse  directions.  Often,  ground  improvement  is  required  after  construction  of  the  piles  to  cut  off  groundwater  flows  from  between  the  piles.  Careful  attention must be paid to waterproofing and corrosion  protection  of  the  structural  steel  members  and  connections.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Typical  steel  core  placement tolerance is 6 in. vertically.   6.5.5—Precast, Prestressed Panel Walls   C6.5.5   Precast,  prestressed  panel  walls  shall  be  designed  and  detailed  similarly  to  conventionally  reinforced  concrete  diaphragm walls.   Precast, prestressed beams may be used for roof framing,  with the connection possibly formed by pockets in the walls  to support the beams.    Detailing of the connection shall be consistent with the   structural system and design assumptions.    Precast, prestressed panel walls with appropriate  details for roof and invert connection in future stages  are lowered into the slurry, requiring careful control of  the  vertical  placement.  The  construction  of  the  wall  then follows the same sequence as that described above  for reinforced concrete diaphragm walls. This type of  construction will provide the best quality wall finish.  This  types  of  wall  becomes  less  practical  for  deeper  excavations and in locations where utility crossing or  obstructions can be expected.   6.5.6—Cast-in-Place Concrete Box Structures   C6.5.6   Cast-in-place  concrete  box  structures  shall  be  detailed  according  to  Section  5  of  the  LRFD  Specifications  and  additional  requirements  of  these  Specifications,  with  the  following modifications:   •  When  the  structure  lies  below  the  water  table,  the  minimum  amount  of  temperature  and  shrinkage  reinforcement shall be increased 100 percent for all  members of cast-in-place concrete box structures.  •  The  maximum  spacing  of  the  temperature  and   shrinkage reinforcement shall be 12 in.   Cast-in-place concrete box structures are the most  common system used for cut-and-cover tunnels. Cast- in-place  concrete  can  be  easily  adjusted  to  accommodate any geometric irregularities required by  function.   For  any  buried  structure,  it  is  desirable  to  limit  cracking. Most damage to these structures is caused by  the  infiltration  of  groundwater  through  the  structure  over time. The upfront cost of additional temperature  and shrinkage reinforcement is minimal compared to  the  costs  of  retrofit  leak  mitigation  or  management  systems.  Crack  control  can  be  achieved  with  careful  concrete  mix  design,  wet  curing,  and  closely  distributed  temperature  reinforcement.  Crack  widths  on flexural members are frequently limited to 0.08 in.,  a crack considered to be “self-healing.”   6.5.7—Structural Steel Frames   C6.5.7   Structural  steel  frames  shall  be  detailed  according  to  Section  6  of  the  LRFD  Specifications  and  additional  requirements of this specification.

The  load  combinations of Table 3.4-1 shall be used to investigate the  various limit states herein.   6.6.2—Service Limit State   C6.6.2   Service T-I: Cut-and-cover tunnels shall be investigated  for  deflections,  crack  control,  vibration,  durability,  water  tightness, and fatigue as developed during the service life of  the tunnel.   tunnels   Service  T-IA:  Cut-and-cover   shall  be  investigated for the effects of buoyancy during the service life  of  the  tunnel,  including  but  not  limited  to,  maximum  groundwater elevations and changes in groundwater elevation  caused by tides and flooding. The effect of salinity and other  inclusion  in  groundwater  that  affect  the  unit  weight  of  groundwater shall be included.   Buoyancy  has  traditionally  been  checked  as  a  factor of safety against flotation. However, to include  the  effects of friction against  foundation  and vertical  wall  elements  in  resisting  uplift,  a  service  limit  state  approach to this check is required.   Service T-II: Cut-and-cover tunnels shall be investigated  for  the  effects  of  buoyancy  that  occur  during  construction.  Cut-and-cover tunnels shall be checked for deflection during  temporary bracing conditions when vertical wall elements are  incorporated into the final structure. Ground movement as a  result  of  deflections  of  SOE  walls  that  are  also  permanent  structural walls for the structure shall be evaluated. Adjacent  structures and infrastructure that could be affected by these  ground movements shall be evaluated and protected against  potential adverse effects of the ground movement.   6.6.3—Strength Limit State   Strength  T-II:  Cut-and-cover   Strength T-I: Cut-and-cover tunnels shall be investigated  for  strength  during  normal  use,  under  which  the  tunnel  remains fully serviceable without any damage.   tunnels   shall  be  investigated  for  strength  during  construction  including,  but  not  limited  to,  sequence  of  construction,  installation  and  removal of temporary bracing, backfilling, and construction  stage loading.   6.6.4—Extreme Event Limit State   C6.6.4   Extreme  Event  T-I:  Cut-and-cover  tunnels  shall  be  investigated  for  earthquakes  to  ensure  life  safety  and  survivability of the structure taking progressive collapse into  account. Acceptable levels of damage shall be defined by the  Owner.   Under Extreme Event T-I, the acceptable level of  tunnel  damage  could  members  that  result  in  limited  leakage  and  could  include complete loss of service.    include  partial  failure  of   Extreme  Event  T-II:  Cut-and-cover-tunnels  shall  be  investigated for extreme events other than earthquakes.

The  Owner  may,  at  its  discretion,  and  after  performing a hazard analysis, create load combinations that  have  more  than  one  of  these  loads  applied  to  the  structure  simultaneously. In this case, it is recommended that the load  factors  shown  in  Table  3.4-1  be  used  when  combining  the  loads.   Extreme  Event  T-III:  Cut-and-cover  tunnels  shall  be  investigated for a rare event for the simultaneous combination  of loads such as flooding. This load combination shall be used  for both surface flooding that raises the groundwater elevation  and for flooding of the inside of the tunnel.   Under Extreme Event T-III, the following flooding cases   shall be investigated:   •  Sea  level  or  surface  water  elevations  rise  and  produce  increased  hydrostatic  pressures  on  the  tunnel that also reduce the resistance to buoyancy.   •  Flooding  of  the  inside  of  the  tunnel  occurs  that  increases the resistance to buoyancy and reduces the  net hydrostatic pressure to zero.   6.6.5—Load Factors and Load Combinations   C6.6.5   Cut-and-cover  tunnels  shall  be  designed  for  the  load   combinations shown in Tables 3.4-1 and 3.4-2.    When developing the loads to be applied to the structure,  each  possible  load  combination  of  the  loads  shall  be  developed. Engineering judgment  may be used to eliminate  the combinations that do not govern.   Section 3 provides guidance on the methods to be  used in the computations of the loads applicable to cut- and-cover tunnels. The sequence of construction will  impact loading and assumptions. For example, in top- down construction, permanent SOE walls used as part  of the final structure will receive heavier bearing loads  because the roof is placed and loaded before the base  slab is constructed. The permanent SOE walls are also  braced  as  the  excavation  progresses  below  the  roof  slab,  resulting  in  a  different  lateral  soil  pressure  distribution than would be found in the free-standing  walls of a cast-in-place concrete structure constructed  using bottom-up construction. The base slab of a top- down constructed tunnel acts as a mat for supporting  vertical loads, but it is not available until towards the  end of construction of the section, eliminating its use  to resist moments from the walls or to act as bracing  for the walls.   Structures  are  subjected  to  a  wide  range  of  load  combinations  during  construction.  These  include  the  variability  of  dead  and  live  loads  on  partially  completed  configurations,  erection  and  equipment  loads,  and  the  full  range  of  environmental  loads  to  which  the  final  structure  is  subjected,  although  with  differences  attributable  to  return  period  of  events  (storm, earthquake), duration (horizontal pressures due  to  equipment  loading),  or  intensity  (earth  pressures  changing  from  active  to  at-rest).  Chapter  2  of  ASCE 37,  “Design  Loads  on  Structures  during  Construction,”  discusses  the  formulation  of  load  combinations and development of load factors for the  different cases in a manner that allows the Engineer to   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Ground movement can be due to:  •  Excavations for utility relocations, guide wall  construction,  pre-trenching  for  guide  walls,  and slurry panel installation.   •  Deflection  of   the  SOE  walls  during   excavation for the tunnel structure.   •  Consolidation  due   to  dewatering  during  construction and during the service life of the  tunnel.   Ground  movement  during  excavation  and  construction  and  its  effects  on  adjacent  structures,  utilities,  and  other  infrastructure  shall  be  carefully  considered  in  all  phases  of  design  and  construction.  Ground  movement  shall  be  explicitly  addressed  the  development  of  contract  documents  and  carefully  monitored  in  the  field  once  the  construction  begins.  movements  of  adjacent  existing  structures  shall  be  in  place  during  construction.  Threshold  values  and  values  for  total  permissible  movement  of  the  facility  being  monitored  shall  be established.    Instrumentation   to  monitor   in   Detailed analysis and monitoring shall be performed in  advance to predict these movements accurately and to adjust  the design if necessary.    Numerical  modeling  shall  be  performed  to  estimate   ground movements at each stage of the construction.    Mitigation  measures  shall  be  designed  to  limit  ground  movements to values that can be tolerated by the feature being  studied.   Existing buildings and facilities shall be evaluated for the  soil movement estimated to occur due to excavation activities  for construction of cut-and-cover tunnels. This evaluation is  not within the scope of this Specification.   6.7.2—Buoyancy   C6.7.2   Cut-and-cover  tunnels  that  are  partially  or  completely  below  the  water  table  shall  be  evaluated  for  the  effect  of  buoyancy unless a pressure relief system is provided beneath  the invert slab. See Article 6.11 for requirements for pressure  relief systems. Buoyancy forces shall be computed using the  density of the groundwater at the site. Adequate resistance to  flotation  shall  be  provided  at  all  sections  for  the  full  hydrostatic uplift pressure on the structure’s foundation. The  following requirements shall be met:   In  general,  the  preferred  method  for  resisting  buoyancy is utilizing the dead weight of the structure.  In cases where this is not practical, consideration may  be given to the utilization of drilled shafts, driven piles,  and skin friction on RCDW and SPTC slurry panels or  on tangent or secant piles. When these methods prove  impractical, consideration may be given to the use of  permanent tie-down anchors to assist in the resistance  to buoyancy.    •  The  base  slab  shall  be  designed  to  resist  the  uplift  pressure acting at the bottom of the base slab. The  water  level  shall  be  determined  from  the  site  investigation considering mean high water level and  long-term flood events as mandated by the Owner or  local jurisdiction.

When  used,  the  design  of  the  anchors  shall be performed in accordance with:  −  FHWA-IF-99-015 Geotechnical Engineering  Circular No.4 Ground Anchors and Anchored  Systems   −  PTI  DC35.1-14  Recommendations  Prestressed Rock and Soil Anchors   for   FHWA (1999) indicates that tie-down anchors can  be  used  to  resist  hydrostatic  uplift.  The  Owner  shall  make  the  determination  as  to  the  acceptability  of  permanent tie-down anchors for resisting buoyancy.   6.7.2.1—Partially Completed Structure   C6.7.2.1   A  construction  sequence,  together  with  all  temporary  measures  necessary  to  provide  adequate  resistance  against  flotation during all stages of construction, shall be indicated  on the contract drawings. Resistance shall consist of the dead  load  of  the  completed  portion  of  the  structure  and  any  additional resistance provided by the provisions indicated in  the construction sequence documents.    Friction  between  soil  and  wall  elements  shall  be   neglected when calculating resistance during construction.    If the main structure is not symmetrical, rotational effects   due to the buoyancy shall be considered.   Contractors generally elect to work in the dry and  pump  out  any  water  that  makes  its  way  into  the  excavation. Often, loss of power to the pumps results  in  the  flow  of  the  water  into  the  excavation,  so  that  flotation is quickly counteracted by the weight of water  above the completed slab.   6.7.2.2—Complete Structure   C6.7.2.2   The  complete  structure  shall  be  evaluated  for  the  buoyancy effect considering the resistance of the dead weight  of  the  complete  structure,  plus  the  weight  of  the  backfill  overlaying the cut-and-cover tunnel within the vertical plane  through  the  outer  edge  of  the  roof.

Some  provision  for  future  construction  over  the  in- service tunnel shall be made, so that buoyancy need not be a  concern  for  routine  works  that  may  be  expected  above  the  finished structure.

If the foundations of the adjacent buildings are supported  by underpinning and/or deep foundations that transfer loads  to  a  depth  below  the  influence  line  of  the  tunnel,  these  additional loads need not be applied to the tunnel.   When the loads from the adjacent structures are not equal  on both sides of the tunnel, the most critical unbalanced load  case shall be investigated. As a minimum, the following basic  non-seismic loading cases shall be investigated.   6.7.3.1—Symmetrical Loading   The following cases shall be investigated:  Case  I:  Maximum  vertical  loads  including  dead  loads,  live  loads,  surcharge  loads,  and  hydrostatic  pressure  with  maximum lateral pressure due to soil and rock.   Case II: Minimum vertical load (dead load only), with  maximum hydrostatic pressure and maximum lateral pressure  due to soil and rock.   Case  III:  Maximum  vertical  loads  and  minimum  hydrostatic pressure and lateral pressure due to soil and rock.   6.7.3.2—Asymmetrical Loading   C6.7.3.2   The following cases shall be investigated:  Case  I:  Maximum  vertical  loads  including  dead  loads,  live  loads,  surcharge  loads,  and  hydrostatic  pressure  with  lateral pressure as follows:    Where  SOE  walls  are  incorporated  into  the  permanent  structure,  the  design  of  the  connections  between walls and roof or invert slabs is governed by  the unbalanced lateral load combinations.   Maximum  lateral  pressures  (at-rest)  due  to  soil  loads  applied to one side of the structure and active pressure from  soil on the opposite side.   Case II: Maximum vertical loads including dead loads,  live  loads,  and  surcharge  loads  with  maximum  lateral  pressure (at-rest) due to soil loads applied to one side of the  structure and active pressure from soil on the opposite side.   Case  III:  For  cases  where  a  partial  or  full-depth  excavation that cannot be braced is anticipated on only one  side  of  the  cut-and-cover  structure,  the  cut-and-cover  structure shall be designed for zero lateral earth pressure to  the depth of the anticipated excavation on the excavated side  of  the  structure  with  at-rest  earth  pressure  on  the  opposite  side.   Unbalanced  earth  pressures  that  cause  sways  over  0.005H  should  be  reviewed  with  respect  to  the  loading  conditions, since such cases are unlikely to represent a true  loading  condition.  H  is  taken  as  the  height  of  vertical  wall  from the bottom of the invert slab to top of the roof slab.   6.7.3.3—Construction Condition   C6.7.3.3   Construction  sequence  and  procedures  may  result  in  conditions  that  are  more  severe  than  the  general  loading  conditions mentioned in the previous sections. Stresses in the  partially  completed  structure  shall  be  checked  for  the  appropriate  critical  conditions  at  the  various  stages  of  construction.   The  Engineer  shall  be  responsible  for  developing  a  construction  scheme  and  to  clearly  state  assumptions  regarding  the  scheme  in  the  contract  documents.  If  the   Intermediate  stages  of  the  construction  may  induce  higher  stresses  than  the  end  of  construction  stage and govern the design of structural members.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Train loads shall be distributed according to guidelines   provided in AREMA (2014).   6.7.3.5—Superimposed Loads   Superimposed  loads  are  defined  in  Section  3  of  the  LRFD  Specifications and  shall  be  calculated  and  applied  to  cut-and-cover tunnels in load combinations as applicable.   Cut-and-cover construction is often used in urban areas  and  provisions  shall  be  made  for  the  structures  to  support  urban loadings such as future building developments, parks,  or roadways. Future loadings provided for in the design shall  be clearly identified in the contract documents.   6.8—JOINTS   6.8.1—General   Joints in concrete construction shall be categorized as:  construction joints, which allow discrete concrete placements  in  a  continuous  structure;  contraction  joints;  and  expansion  joints.   Joints  shall  be  carefully  detailed  to  prevent  the  infiltration  of  water  yet  simultaneously  accommodate  the  movements expected over time.   All joints shall be provided with waterstops.   Concrete  mixes  for  cut-and-cover  structures  shall  be  designed  to  limit  the  heat  of  hydration,  using  the  same  provisions that are applied to mass concrete placements. Such  provisions may include the substitution of blast furnace slag  or fly ash for portland cement to reduce the heat of hydration,  control curing in the wet, and for the control and monitoring  of temperature differentials across the curing section.   C6.8.1   A main objective in the design of joint spacing is  to  try  to  control  the  locations  where  the  concrete  cracks.  In  cut-and-cover  structures,  cracks  are  locations where water will infiltrate into the structure,  often causing structural and systems degradation over  time.   Provisions  to  control  cracking  include  heavier  longitudinal  shrinkage)  reinforcement and the detailing of joints to control the  locations where cracking occurs.    (temperature   and   Shrinkage during initial curing is a major cause of   concrete cracking.    6.8.2—Construction Joints   C6.8.2   Construction  joints  shall  be  detailed  for  structural  continuity,  with  joint  surfaces  intentionally  roughened  and  saturated with water or coated with bonding agent and with  reinforcement  extending  a  lap  length  into  the  next  concrete  placement.

Contraction joints may be as  simple as a saw-cut on the exposed face or the installation of  a zip-strip.   6.8.4—Expansion Joints   Expansion  joints  shall  be  designed  to  accommodate  expansion  of  adjacent  units  and  relative  movements  of  dissimilar adjoining structure configurations, such as a tunnel  entering  a  ventilation  structure  or  abutting  a  tunnel  of  a  different construction.    Provisions  for  expansion  shall  be  made  when  a  structural  element  is  partially  underground  and  partially  above  ground,  and  where  the  above  ground  element  is  attached to the underground element, particular care shall be  taken  in  detailing  to  accommodate  differential  thermal  movement.   The  following  are  minimum  requirements  for  the   expansion joints:  •  Reinforcement steel shall not be continuous through the   joint.    •  Shear  forces  shall  be  transferred  across  the  joint,   preferably by a key.    •  All expansion joints in structures subject to hydrostatic   pressure shall contain waterstops.   6.9—STRUCTURAL ANALYSES   The provisions of Section 4 of the LRFD Specifications   shall apply as amended herein.   The analysis of cut-and-cover tunnel structures shall be  performed  utilizing  general  structural  or  geotechnical  beam  capable  engineering  elements/shell elements to represent the tunnel structure and  spring/plate/solid elements to model the surrounding ground.   of  modeling   software   6.9.1—Load Distribution and Sharing   Frame analyses shall be performed using rational elastic  methods  which  consider  the  effect  of  relative  stiffness  of  connected  members,  relative  displacement,  rotation  of  the  joints, and the effects of the axial deformation.    Consideration shall be given to the variations in elastic  properties  and  stress  distribution  of  complex  frameworks  resulting from different construction sequences.   Any limitation on construction operation inherent in the  design assumptions shall be noted on the project documents  and specified in the special provisions.    6.9.2—Ground–Structure Interaction   Numerical  modeling  shall  be  used  to  account  for  ground–structure interaction.  The numerical modeling may  consist  of  beam-spring  (Winkler  springs)  models,  finite  element modeling, or finite difference models.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The  supporting  mechanism  of  the  ground  shall  be  accounted for in analyses that include asymmetrical loadings.  Ground  properties  for  use  in  analyses  that  include  soil– structure interaction shall be determined in accordance with  Section 5.   When beam-springs models are used, stiffness of ground  springs is computed by multiplying the moduli of subgrade  reaction with the tributary area at the corresponding node.   6.9.3—Empirical Methods   Classical force and displacement analysis methods may  be  used  for  determining  force  effects  in  cut-and-cover  structures.  Limitations  of  the  method  used  must  be  understood by the Engineer, and the design shall account for  the  limitations.  It  is  recommended  that  these  techniques  be  used  only  for  preliminary  member  sizing  or  as  a  way  to  evaluate  the  reasonableness  of  the  results  of  numerical  analysis.   6.9.4—Frame Analyses   Frame  analyses  shall  be  performed  for  all  permanent   components of cut-and-cover tunnels.    The following loading conditions shall be considered in   the frame analyses:   •  Balanced  earth  pressure  or  symmetrical  conditions with at-rest lateral earth pressure   load   •  Balanced  earth  pressure  in  combination  with  the   seismic loadings   •  Unbalanced earth pressure   6.10—WATERPROOFING   C6.10   Waterproofing shall be designed to resist the anticipated   hydrostatic pressures. Waterproofing systems may include:   •  Waterstops  •  Gaskets  •  Membrane waterproofing  •  Liquid applied waterproofing   the   required  by   Waterproofing  systems  are  manufactured  by  a  number  of  companies.  In  general,  details  of  system  application  are  left  up  to  the  manufacturer,  whose  responsibility  to  the  facility  owner  is  inherent  in  the  warranty  specification.  Most  manufacturers will not warrant their product unless the  seaming, penetration, and termination details that they  have developed and tested are used in the installation.

Blind side membranes may be treated to  bond  or  adhere  to  the  wet  concrete.  These  are  often  applied directly to the excavation cut or shoring wall.  Membranes  may  also  be  rolled  out  over  cured  concrete.   Liquid applied waterproofing:   A  number  of  companies  manufacture  liquid  compounds  that  cure  in  place  to  form  membranes.  These may be painted on or spray applied.   6.10.1—Treatment of Penetrations   Most  cut-and-cover   local  penetrations for utility entrances.

Permissible leakage criteria shall be given in the contract  specifications  the  construction. The tunnel drainage system shall be designed to  accommodate the project leakage criteria.   the  acceptability  of   to  determine   Criteria generally include a measured infiltration  of volume/ft2/day and a maximum flow at any single  point.  Typical  criteria  range  from  0.0002  to  0.01  gals/ft2/day, with 0.02 gallon per minute of flow from  any single leak. The Owner shall establish the required  leakage criteria. Factors to consider when establishing  long-term  permissible  management  of  the  incoming  water,  the  selected  structural system and associated number of joints, and  constituent components of the groundwater including  groundwater chemistry and contaminants.   leakage   include   the   6.11—PRESSURE RELIEF SYSTEMS   C6.11   Pressure   relief  systems   the  hydrostatic  pressure  shall  be  sized  and  detailed  to  function  with minimal maintenance in the in-situ conditions to which  they are subjected.   installed   reduce   to   The  effect  of  potential  localized  lowering  of  the  groundwater  table,  including  settlement  of  surrounding  ground and the impact of that settlement on adjacent existing  infrastructure,  by  pressure  relief  systems  shall  be  analyzed.  Mitigation  measures  for  anticipated  settlement  shall  be  designed.   Management of the water collected shall be considered   when deciding to build a pressure relief system.   Long-term  pumping  equipment  and  a  pressure  monitoring system shall be provided to ensure the long-term  performance of the pressure relief system.   Pressures imposed on drained structures may be  less  than  those  imposed  on  structures  that  are  sealed  and  fully  immersed.  Drainage  systems  provide  this  pressure  relief.    However,  drainage  systems  must  be  maintained, because they tend to clog and allow water  pressures  to  build  behind  the  structure.  In  general,  a  gravel bedding layer is placed under the invert slab and  large  diameter  perforated  pipes  at  the  base  of  the  structural  walls,  with  closely  spaced  clean-outs,  are  required.   An  additional  concern  in  urban  areas  is  the  capacity of municipal sewage treatment plants. Many  sewerage  agencies  will  not  allow  groundwater  to  be  pumped into their systems.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  All rights reserved.

The excavation is performed  with an open  face and can be performed with or without the use of a  shield. The use of a shield is dependent upon the ground  conditions.   Bored  tunnels  in  soil  or  rock  are  constructed   utilizing a tunnel boring machine (TBM).   The  ground  surrounding  a  tunnel  can  act  as  a  supporting  mechanism,  loading  mechanism,  or  both,  depending on the nature of the ground, the tunnel size,  and the method and sequence of constructing the tunnel.  Thus, the rock or soil surrounding a tunnel is considered  a construction material and shall be taken into account  in the design of tunnel linings.   The provisions of this Section apply to the planning  design, evaluation, and rehabilitation of the permanent  lining for tunnels constructed by tunnel boring machine  (TBM)  or  mining.  The  lining  types  covered  by  this  Section are as follows:   \\uf0b7  \\uf0b7  \\uf0b7  \\uf0b7  \\uf0b7  Cast-in-place concrete (reinforced or structural plain concrete) Precast concrete segmental linings (reinforced with reinforcing steel bars or steel fibers) Initial  precast  concrete  segmental  linings (reinforced with reinforcing steel bars or steel fibers  or  constructed  from  structural  plain concrete) Shotcrete  (reinforced  with linings  reinforcing  steel  bars,  lattice  girders,  or  steel fibers  or  constructed  from  structural  plain shotcrete) Pre-fabricated steel liner  final   Bored  and  mined  tunnels  and  their  components  shall be designed to sustain the most severe combination  of  loads  to  which  they  may  be  subjected  during  construction, when the construction is complete, and the  tunnel is in service.    Effects of temporary loads during the construction  of mined and bored tunnel structures shall be considered  in the design.   Refer  to  Section  3  for  load  factors  and  load  combinations that shall be considered during the design  of mined and bored tunnels.    Refer  to  Section  4  for  material  properties  and  resistance  factors  that  shall  be  considered  during  the  design of mined and bored tunnels.   Refer to Section 9 for the design of initial ground   support elements and ground improvement.   Refer  to  Section  10  for  seismic  considerations   during the design of mined and bored tunnels.   7.2—DEFINITIONS   Final Lining—The permanent tunnel structure, constructed within an excavation which has been supported by initial  support elements installed concurrently with excavation.   Horizon—The cross section of a tunnel, cross passage intersected by a plane perpendicular to the centerline of the  tunnel.   Lattice Girder—A ground support element consisting of an open lattice of three or four steel bars connected by lacing  bars and encapsulated with shotcrete, which is sprayed through the open-work lattice.   Overbreak—Quantity of rock actually excavated beyond the perimeter established as the desired tunnel excavated  cross section.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

This function of support may be enhanced by installation of systematic tunnel pre- support and local support where required by ground conditions. It typically consists of reinforced shotcrete, rock  reinforcement, pre-support, steel rib, or lattice girder sets, or combinations thereof.

A  subsurface  investigation  shall  be  performed  to  obtain  information on the ground conditions to:   \\uf0b7 Define the subsurface profile \\uf0b7 Determine soft ground and rock material properties  \\uf0b7  and mass characteristics Identify  geotechnical  anomalies,  fault  zones,  and other hazards  \\uf0b7 Define hydrogeological conditions \\uf0b7 Determine the presence of hazardous materials \\uf0b7  Identify potential construction risks  Subsurface investigations such as boring, sampling, in- situ  testing,  geophysical  investigation,  and  laboratory  material testing are essential to obtain design parameters for  the  tunnel  lining,  and  to  define  the  best  and  most  cost- effective route and location for mined or bored tunnels.   to  Section  5   Refer  for  mined  and  bored  considerations  requirements for subsurface investigations.   for   special  geotechnical  tunnels  and   the   The tunnel lining and the surrounding ground act  together  to  create  a  stable  opening  for  the  tunnel.

Minimum  requirements for spacing of bore holes and laboratory  testing are presented in Section 5. Owners and funding  agencies  often  have  supplemental  requirements  for  more comprehensive programs that may also be tied to  risk management. Owner and funding agency specific  requirements  in  excess  of  those  contained  in  these  specifications  should  be  considered  when  planning  a  subsurface investigation program.  7.4.1.2—Ground Classification   C7.4.1.2   For  mined and bored tunneling, ground classifications  vary  between  soft  ground  and  hard  rock.  As  a  naturally  occurring material, great variation within these two generic  classifications can be expected along the tunnel alignment.  The  ground  classification  and  characteristics  often  determine the most feasible tunneling methodology. Further  information regarding ground classifications can be found in  AASHTO (2010).   The  characteristics  of  the  ground  around  a  mined  or  bored tunnel influence both how much the tunnel lining can  deflect  during  construction  and  service  and  how  much  pressure  the  ground  will  exert  on  the  structure  over  time.  These properties of the ground determine the nature of the  ground/structure  interaction  that  creates  the  loading  in  the  lining.   Earth pressures shall be calculated in accordance with   Section 3.   Ground  classification  determines  the  expected  behavior during tunneling which in turn determines the  most  appropriate  tunnel  construction  methodology.  Other aspects such as groundwater conditions and the  surrounding  surface  and  near  surface  infrastructure  also  influence  the  determination  of  applicable  tunnel  construction methodologies.    The length of the tunnel must also be considered  in  conjunction  with  ground  classification  in  determining  the  economically  appropriate  tunneling  methodology  since  the  cost  of  a  TBM  may  not  be  economical for a relatively short tunnel length, even if  the ground conditions are ideal for the use of a TBM.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The effect of the hydrostatic  pressure shall be considered whenever the groundwater table  is detected within the tunnel horizon or may be reasonably  expected to occur within the tunnel horizon over time.    Groundwater  levels  to  be  used  for  the  design  shall be  established  in  accordance  with  Sections  3  and  5  and  as  modified in this Article.    Long-term variations in the groundwater level shall be  considered  in  establishing  design  groundwater  elevation.  Flood  conditions  with  500-year  return  period  shall  be  investigated during the design and shall be evaluated as an  extreme load case during the design phase.   In   the  absence  of  definitive  data,  groundwater  elevations for the design of non-extreme load combinations  shall  be  taken  as  5  ft  above  and  5  ft  below  observed  groundwater elevations in order to account for seasonal and  tidal variations.   The  presence  of  groundwater  will  influence  the  selection of the tunnel construction methodology, the  need  for  ground  improvement,  and  the  design  of  the  tunnel lining.   Hydrostatic pressure can create  large  axial loads  in  the  tunnel  lining  that  can  offset  the  moments  generated  by  applied  ground  and  surcharge  loads.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  explore  a  range  of  groundwater  design  values  since  a  lower  hydrostatic  pressure may produce the governing load effect for the  lining design.   The presence of groundwater will also impact the   design of the waterproofing system for the tunnel.   Pressure  relief  systems  can  be  used  to  relieve  groundwater  pressures.  Pressure  relief  systems  are  installed  between  the  initial  and  permanent  ground  support  systems.  See  Article  6.11  for  additional  information.   7.4.1.4—In-Situ Ground Stresses   C7.4.1.4   Load effects on tunnel initial and final linings from the  surrounding  ground  shall  be  evaluated  for  the  following  possible sources of loads:   \\uf0b7 Overburden, surcharge, or vertical pressure \\uf0b7 Horizontal pressure due to vertical pressure \\uf0b7 Squeezing due to release of in-situ pressure \\uf0b7 Uniform rock loads \\uf0b7 Block rock loads \\uf0b7 Varying  ground  conditions  around   the  perimeter of the tunnel  \\uf0b7 Varying  ground  conditions  along  the  tunnel  alignment Seismic effects  \\uf0b7  The investigation of the load effects shall be based on   ground/structure interaction.    The  state  of  stress  in  the  ground  surrounding  a  tunnel  is  changed  when  excavation  begins.  An  understanding  of  the  in-situ  state  of  stress  can  be  subsurface  gained  investigation.  The  change  in  the  state  of  stress  will  determine the load effects in the initial ground support  and in the final tunnel lining.    comprehensive   through   a   the   load  carrying  capacity  of   Utilizing  the  change  of  the  state  of  stress  to  the  maximize  surrounding ground is the underlying concept in tunnel  design. This concept assumes that the ground and the  structure act in concert to create a stable opening with  the  ground  supporting  the  majority  of  the  load  redistribution  that  occurs  during  excavation.  Thin,  flexible structural members are utilized that allow the  ground deformations required to mobilize the strength  of  the  surrounding  ground.  This  redistribution  of  stresses around the tunnel opening results in maximum  usage  of  the  load  carrying  capacity  of  the  ground,  while  minimizing  the  bending  and  shear  in  the  structural  members,  thereby  optimizing  the  overall  design.   The  redistribution  of  stresses  also  results  in  movement of the ground. Ground movement needs to  be managed in order to mitigate impacts the movement  may  have  on  existing  facilities  and  structures.  The  management of the ground movements is done through  the timing of the installation of the ground support and  the  stiffening  of  the  structural  elements  used  to  maintain the stability of the opening. This can lead to  increased  load  on  the  structural  elements.

Often, early stripping of formwork for cast- in-place concrete is beneficial to the construction schedule  and  can  provide  economy  during  construction.  When  high  strength  is  required  prior  to  stripping  forms,  consideration  should be given to the use of high early strength concrete.

C7.4.2.1   Cast-in-place  concrete  is  commonly  used  to  construct  tunnel  linings  for  mined  tunnels.  The  geometry of the lining for mined tunnels is established  to minimize moment load effects to the greatest extent  possible.  Cast-in-place  concrete  can  be  formed  and  poured to any geometric shape.    When ground conditions are such that immediate  lining  of  the  tunnel  excavation  is  not  required,  for  example, tunnels constructed in competent rock, then  cast-in-place  concrete  can  also  be  used  to  line  bored  tunnels.  Initial  support  is  installed  as  the  TBM  advances,  and  a  cast-in-place  final  lining  is  installed  against a waterproofing membrane. Initial support can  be in the form of reinforcement elements such as rock  dowels  or  bolts,  shotcrete  (reinforced  or  plain),  or  precast  concrete  segments  (reinforced  or plain).  This  construction  sequence  is  known  as  a  two-pass  lining  system.

To ensure that the behavior  is equivalent to monolithic concrete, it is essential to  limit  the  time  lag  between  the  applications.  It  is  recommended  that  a  bonding  agent  be  used  between  layers.    Shotcrete  is  frequently  used  as  a  smoothing  layer  applied to irregular rock surfaces prior to the application of  waterproofing  membranes. Shotcrete  may also  be  used  for  initial  ground  support  in  mined  tunnels,  alone,  or  in  combination with other support elements.

TBMs  can  operate  with  or  without  shields,  with  an  open  or  pressurized  face, with conventional excavation equipment, rotating  cutterheads, or any combination of the above.    TBMs are typically utilized for longer tunnels and can  be  equipped  with  or  without  shields.  TBM  construction  results  in  a  circular  opening  that  may  not  be  the  most  efficient shape required for internal dimensioning. When the  ground  is  not  capable  of  supporting  itself  temporarily  or  when  groundwater  conditions  are  such  that  construction  without  the  use  of  a  shield  is  not  feasible,  TBMs  are  equipped  with  shields.  Because  of  the  length  of  the  excavating mechanism, shield, and trailing gear, TBMs are  restricted in the alignment geometry that can be constructed  along curves both horizontally and vertically.   Design of initial support systems for mined and bored  tunnels  is  based  on  information  developed  from  the  subsurface  investigation  program.  Actual  conditions  encountered  during  construction  will  dictate  the  initial  support system used during construction.    7.5.2—Construction of Mined Tunnel Structures   C7.5.2   Construction  of  mined  tunnels  is  performed  through  various excavation techniques that all fall under the general  category  of  sequential  excavation.

The sequencing includes both the area of the  face that is excavated at one time (drift) and the length of  excavation  performed  prior  to  installation  of  the  initial  support (round). The drift can be the entire tunnel face at one  time or it can  be subdivided into multiple sections. Round  lengths will vary as a function of the time limit required to  install the initial support. This methodology is also known  as the Sequential Excavation Method (SEM).   Ground  movements  will  occur  within  the  excavation  and  are  managed  by  limiting  the  size  of  the  drift  and  the  length of the round.    The  excavated  opening  created  during  each  drift  excavation is made stable through the use of initial ground  support.  The  initial  ground  support  can  consist  of  ground  improvement  or  structural  elements  installed  prior  to  excavating the drift, or can be structural elements installed  after  excavation  of  the  drift,  or  a  combination  of  support  installed  before  and  after  excavation.  The  type  and  configuration of  required initial  ground support  is  dictated  by  the  ground  and  groundwater  conditions  and  the  requirements for limiting ground movements. The type and  configuration of the required initial support, along with time  restrictions for installation of the support, are referred to as  excavation support classes (ESC).   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Additional  stress  redistribution  will  occur over time until a state of equilibrium is reached. Each  phase of the excavation and lining construction along with  the permanent long-term condition shall be investigated to  determine the load effects in the support elements, as well as  in the surrounding ground.   Ground  conditions  will  vary  within  the  length  of  a  tunnel.  The  contract  documents  shall  provide  information  regarding  the  ground  conditions  to  be  expected  along  the  tunnel  length,  where  each  ESC  may  be  required,  and  the  details required to construct both the initial support and the  final structural lining.    The number of ESCs should be kept to a  minimum to   maximize efficiency and economy of construction.   The  contract  documents  shall  address  permissible   overbreak for rock tunnel excavation.   During construction, experienced personnel must  be on site to determine the ESC required as each drift  of the tunnel is excavated. Records of the tunneling and  installation of ESC should be kept for the entire length  of the tunnel. Instrumentation installed and monitored  during construction provides real-time data regarding  the  performance  of  the  ESC.  Instrumentation  data  related to ground movements is used to modify ESCs  as required and to ensure that project criteria regarding  ground movements are not exceeded.   Overbreak  is  an  unavoidable  part  of  rock  tunnel  construction.  Overbreak  will  change the  geometry of  the  tunnel  opening.  The  geometry  of  the  tunnel  opening is the fundamental assumption in the design.  Changes  in  the  geometry  will  affect  the  design  and  performance  of  tunnel  structural  elements.  Increased  overbreak  will  also  result  in  increased  quantities for items such as excavation, initial ground  support, and structural linings.   the   7.5.3—Construction of Bored Tunnel Structures   C7.5.3   The  Engineer   This approach is called a one-pass lining.

Properly  designed  TBMs  are  capable  of  traversing  varying  ground  conditions  along  a  tunnel  alignment. They are capable of installing initial ground  support as they proceed, which is followed by a final  cast-in-place concrete lining. This approach is called a  two-pass  lining.  TBMs  can  also  install  a  precast  segmental  tunnel  lining  designed  for  the  initial  and  final conditions.    7.6—LIMIT STATE AND RESISTANCE FACTORS   7.6.1—General   Design  of  mined  and  bored  tunnels  shall  satisfy  the  criteria for the service limit states specified in Article 7.6.2,  the  strength  limit  state  specified  in  Article  7.6.3,  and  the  extreme limit states specified in Article 7.6.4.

Sumps  are  equipped  with  pumps  that  discharge  the  collected  fluids  to  the  tunnel  piping  system.   Ancillary spaces encompass a large range of uses,  including  mechanical  and  electrical  rooms,  systems  rooms,  storage,  niches  for  equipment  or  ventilation  fans, and local widening of the tunnel cross section to  provide refuge space for disabled vehicles.   lining   Cross  passages,  sumps,  and  ancillary  spaces,  when required, can be constructed before or after the  final  is  constructed.

Temporary  stresses  supports inside the main tunnel lining are required to  stabilize the tunnel lining by creating redistributed load  paths that allow sections of the lining to be removed  that  are  large  enough  for  construction  of  the  cross  passage, sump, or ancillary space.    in   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The  following  sections  set  forth  requirements  and  limitations of various methodologies for evaluating ground  movements during construction. Techniques for evaluating  ground  movements  include  empirical,  analytical,  and  numerical methods.   Ground  movement  during  excavation  and  construction,  and  its  effects  on  adjacent  structures,  utilities,  and  other  infrastructure  must  be  carefully  considered  in  all  phases  of  design  and  construction.  Ground movement must be explicitly addressed in the  development  of  contract  documents  and  carefully  monitored  in  the  field  once  construction  begins.  Instrumentation to monitor the movements of adjacent  existing  structures  should  be  in  place  and  actively  monitored  prior  to  construction,  during  construction,  and for a period of time after construction to confirm  that  the  ground  has  stabilized.

The   and  numerical  approaches generally involve simplifying assumptions  regarding  the  ground  conditions,  tunnel  excavation  process,  and  quality  of  workmanship.  These  simplifying  assumptions  include  assuming  that  site  soils  are  either  pure  sands  or  pure  clays,  whereas  in  nature  soils  are  mixtures  of  sands,  silts,  clays,  and  gravels.  Empirical  and  analytical  analyses  may  also  require  assuming  that  the  ground  profile  consists  entirely of one type of soil, such as sand or clay, and  so the most prevalent or dominant soil type is assumed  for the entire profile at a particular location. Numerical  analyses  may  involve  assuming  that  the  excavation  takes  place  entirely  under  total  stress  (undrained),  effective  stress  (drained),  or  partially  drained  conditions.   Analytical  and  numerical  analyses   include  simplifying  assumptions  related  to  ground  behavior,  such  as  assuming  elastic  or  plastic  deformations,  ground relaxation, etc. The development of analytical  and numerical  methods often  includes comparison to  observed  behavior  on  previous  projects  to  assess  the  ability of the methods to predict performance on future  projects.  Although  the  methods  vary  in  the  level  of  detail, they are  all approximations used to  model the  ground behavior.

Joints  must  be  carefully detailed to prevent the infiltration of  water,  yet  simultaneously  accommodate  the  movements  expected over time.   and   Shrinkage during initial curing is a major cause of  concrete  cracking.  Concrete  mixes  for  mined  and  bored tunnel structures should be designed to limit the  heat of  hydration,  using the  same  provisions that are  applied  to  mass  concrete  placements.  Provisions  include the substitution of blast furnace slag or fly ash  for  portland  cement  to  reduce  the  heat  of  hydration,  careful  curing  in  the  wet,  and  the  control  and  monitoring  of  temperature  differentials  across  the  curing section.   Three  types  of  joints  in  concrete  construction  are  joints,  which  allow  commonly  detailed:  construction  discrete  concrete  placements  in  a  continuous  structure;  contraction joints; and expansion joints.    A main objective in the design of joint spacing is to try  to control the locations where the concrete cracks. In mined  and bored tunnel structures, cracks are locations where water  will  infiltrate  into  the  structure,  often  causing  structural  degradation over time.    All joints in cast-in-place concrete and shotcrete  shall   be provided with waterstops.    7.8.2—Construction Joints   Construction  joints  occur  between  discrete  concrete  placements. They shall be detailed for structural continuity,  with  joint  surfaces  intentionally  roughened  and  saturated  with  water  or  coated  with  bonding  agent,  and  with  reinforcement extending a lap length into the next concrete  placement.    7.8.3—Contraction Joints   Contraction  joints  are  designed  to  encourage  the  concrete  to  crack  at  the  joint  location  as  it  shrinks  during  curing or temperature changes. Contraction joints may be as  simple as a saw-cut on the exposed face or the installation of  a zip-strip.   7.8.4—Expansion Joints   Expansion   to  accommodate  joints  are  designed  expansion  of  adjacent  units  and  relative  movements  of  dissimilar  adjoining  structure  configurations,  such  as  a  tunnel entering a ventilation structure or abutting a tunnel of  a different construction.

The  provisions  of  this  Section  apply  to  the  analysis  and  design  of  immersed  tunnels  constructed  of  elements  of  steel,  concrete,  or  a  combination thereof.    This Section includes provisions for loads that may  be  encountered  during  the  construction  of  immersed  tunnels. Provisions for permanent loads are contained in  Section 3.   This  Section  also  includes  provisions  for  detailing   and inspectability.   Temporary  works  for  the  fabrication,  launching,  transportation,  immersion,  and  joining  of  elements  are  not  included.  Temporary  support  of  excavation  and  temporary side slopes for open trench excavation are not  covered.   Immersed tunnels are used to cross waterways and  typically include a cut-and-cover section at both ends  of  the  tunnel.  An  immersed  tunnel  consists  of  one  or  more  tunnel  elements,  typically  300  feet  or  more  in  length. The elements may be fabricated on or off of the  tunnel alignment and designed to be floated, either with  or  without  temporary  buoyancy,  to  a  prepared  bed  or  excavation at the bottom of the waterway being crossed.  The elements may consist of reinforced or prestressed  concrete,  concrete  acting  compositely  with  structural  steel,  or  a  steel  structure  with  concrete  infill.  The  elements are fabricated in dry docks, diked basins, on  submersible barges, or on dry land to be launched like  a  ship,  lowered  on  a  ship  lift,  or  floated  when  the  fabrication basin is flooded. The ends of the elements  are  sealed  with  temporary  bulkheads.  The  tunnel  elements are towed to their final location, floated into  position,  lowered  into  the  prepared  bed  and  joined  together.  After  any  additional  foundation  works  have  been completed, the sides are backfilled and most often  some fill is placed on the roof as protection.   8.2—DEFINITIONS   Anchor Release Band—Earthen construction intended to choke the gape of a ship’s anchor, i.e. the space between  the hook and the shank, and bring the anchor to the surface.   Element—A section of immersed tunnel between immersion joints.   Engineer—Agency, design firm, or person responsible for the design of the tunnel and/or review of design related  field submittals.   Fabrication Facility—A dry dock, diked area, or factory used to build the immersed tunnel elements.    Fully Serviceable—The state of a tunnel under which all traffic normally permitted to travel through the tunnel can  do so safely, with all tunnel systems functioning to the extent required for safe travel.   General Fill—Backfill that is placed above the horizontal axis of the element after placement.    Heeling Moment—A moment (a force x distance) about the longitudinal axis in the transverse direction which  induces roll (heel). The investigation of heeling moments is an important consideration to an element’s stability.    Immersed Tunnel—A tunnel that is built in sections (elements) in the dry and then floated to the alignment and  placed.    Immersion—Lowering the tunnel element into place in the trench.    Immersion Joints—Joints between immersed tube elements.   Inner Reinforcement Cage—The reinforcing steel layer closest to the inside of the tunnel.   Joining—Engaging the jacks and pulling the element being placed to the in-place element or existing approach  section.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Locking Fill—Backfill that is placed on either side of the element after placement up to the horizontal axis.   Outfitting—Adding internal concrete to the element after float up in the vicinity of the alignment to obtain a larger  negative buoyancy than was obtained at float up.    Righting Moment—The lateral moment that can be applied to the element without causing it to capsize or heel.   Terminal Joints—Joints between immersed tube elements and approach structures.   8.3—NOTATION   8.3.1—Loads and Load Designations   The following permanent, transient, and construction loads shall be considered and supplement information  given in Section 3:   •  Construction Loads   IN  = immersion  JO  = joining  LA  = launching  TR  = transportation   •  Permanent Loads   SE   = effect of settlement of tunnel structure   •  Transient Loads   WAp = transient water loads   8.3.2—Abbreviations   square feet  gallons  International Tunneling and Underground Space Association  Land Transport Authority (Singapore)   ft2:    gals:   ITA:   LTA:  MSL:  MTRC:    Mass Transit Rail Corporation (Singapore)  PUB:  USACE:    Public Utilities Board (Singapore)  United States Army Corps of Engineers     Mean sea level   8.4—DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS   8.4.1—Determination of Ground Properties   8.4.1.1—General   Subsurface  investigations  and  determination  of  ground  properties  for  design  for  immersed  tunnel  structures shall be as specified in Section 5.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The  foundation  may  be  prepared  either  before  or  after  placing  a  tunnel  element.  Where  improvements  to  the  underlying  soils  are  required,  these  improvements  shall  be prepared prior to preparing the foundation or prior to  placing  the  element,  if  placed  first.  Soil  improvement  may include some form of piles or compaction piles not  in direct contact with the underside of an element, or an  appropriate type of in-situ ground improvement.   Based  upon  seismicity,  analyses  are  required  to  determine the risk of liquefaction of both the underlying  soils and of the foundation materials; soil improvement  may be required to reduce the risk of liquefaction of the  underlying  soils  to  an  acceptable  level.  Foundation  materials shall be selected such that they do not liquefy.  See Section 10 for seismic design requirements.    Acceptable  methods  of  foundation  preparation   include:   •  Screeded  material  onto  which  the  tunnel  element  is  placed. The material shall be capable of transferring  the  loads  from  the  tunnel  element  to  the  underlying  foundation  materials  without  causing  unacceptable  settlement  or  differential  settlement.  Settlement  analyses  shall  be  performed  in  accordance  with  Section 10 of the LRFD Specifications.   •  Sand flow or grouted foundation prepared beneath the  tunnel  element  while  resting  on  temporary  supports.  Sand flow shall not be used in seismic areas where the  sand  bedding  may  be  susceptible  to  liquefaction.  Where  a  grouted  foundation  is  used,  it  may  be  underlain  by  gravel  or  stone.  The  grout  shall  be  the  formulated  such  underlying materials nor mixes with the surrounding  water. Sand jetting is not recommended.   it  neither  penetrates   that   Immersed  tunnels  are  usually  placed  within  an  excavated trench. Some methods of soil improvement  may  need  to  be  carried  out  before  the  trench  is  excavated to the final depth.    Depending upon the level of seismicity, a screeded  foundation  may  consist  of  a  well  graded  material  or  single-sized stone. The material is placed in the trench,  typically through tremie tubes or by clamshell, and then  screeded  (leveled)  to  the  line  and  grade  required  for  element placement using a blade or screed box to form  a  continuous  flat  surface.  An  alternative  and  quicker  method  is  placement  of  the  material  by  the  Dutch  Scrading®  method,  whereby  the  foundation  material  (usually  stone)  is  placed  using  a  computer  controlled  tremie pipe in a zigzag pattern with a slight separation  of the rows. Scrading® is used for all widths of tunnels.  For the sand flow method, a sand–water mixture is  pumped  in  through  pipes  with  orifices  in  a  pattern  below the tunnel. As the mixture is pumped in, it forms  a “pancake” that grows around the orifice in use. The  pumping pressure required increases as the diameter of  the pancake increases. The pancakes shall be arranged  to  overlap  and  to  be  sequenced  such  that  the  entire  underside is filled. Sand flow is particularly useful for  wide tunnel elements but has also been used for narrow  tunnels.   A foundation produced by the grouting  and sand  flow  methods  is  installed  after  an  element  is  placed,  whereas  the  screeded  foundation  is  prepared  before  placing  an  element.  The  grouting  and  sand  flow  methods  may  be  constructed  from  inside  the  tunnel  element,  whereas  the  sand  jetting  method  requires  external  equipment.  Sand  jetting  is  no  longer  used  because it produces a less compacted foundation and is  less  controlled  than  can  be  achieved  using  the  sand  flow  method.  Grouting  using  an  underwater  thixotropic-type  grout  is  used  primarily  when  severe  seismic  conditions  would  make  a  sand  foundation  unsuitable.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

C8.4.1.3   Filling to existing bed level is sometimes required  for  environmental  reasons.  In  most  cases,  any  depression is likely to silt up naturally.   Locking  fill  typically  extends  up  to  about  mid-  height of an element.   Temporary  supports  shall  either  be  released  or  designed  to  fail  under  the  completed  weight  of  the  tunnel  and  the  element  designed  accordingly.  If  the  temporary supports rest on stable concrete pads, any  requirements  for  preloading  and  all  subsequent  behavior of the pads shall be determined.   •  Supported on discrete supports such as pile bents or  drilled  shafts.  Deep  foundation  elements  shall  be  designed  in  accordance  with  Section  10  of  the  AASHTO Specifications.   Foundations, other than discrete supports, shall be at   least 2 feet thick.   to  estimate   longitudinal  and   When  varying  ground  conditions  occur  along  the  tunnel alignment, or when sharp transitions from soil to  rock occur under the tunnel elements, analyses shall be  performed  transverse  differential  settlements  within  each  tunnel  element,  between adjoining tunnel elements, and at the transitions  at the ends of the immersed tunnel. These analyses shall  be performed in accordance with Section 10 of the LRFD  Specifications  to  determine  the  magnitude  of  potential  differential  settlement.  The  tunnel  elements  shall  be  designed  to  accommodate  the  calculated  differential  settlement.   Settlement  of  the  element  while  resting  on  the  foundation pads shall be monitored and corrections made  to  the  element  elevation  in  event  that  movement  takes  place.   See Section 3 for additional design requirements for   foundation settlement.   8.4.1.3—Fill Material   Fill  materials  (backfill)  shall  consist  of  locking  fill  and general fill. The graduation of the materials shall be  such that they cannot liquefy during a seismic event.   Locking  fill  shall  consist  of  appropriately-graded  self-compacting material. Locking fill shall be placed in  thin lifts equally on each side of the tunnel elements such  that  lateral  displacement  of  the  element  during  fill  placement does not occur. The extent of locking fill shall  be sufficient for the element not to be displaced during  subsequent placement of general fill and any protection  thereof.    General fill shall also be placed in lifts to ensure that  displacement  of  the  element  does  not  occur.  The  gradation of the fill materials shall be designed such that  it cannot liquefy in a seismic event. It is common practice  to  place  fill  over  the  top  of  a  tunnel  to  protect  against  sinking ships, falling anchors, etc. The required thickness  of  this  fill  shall  be  sized  by  analysis  and  is typically  at  least  5  feet,  depending  upon  expected  vessel  size  and  anchor  weight;  concrete  ballast  and  concrete  protection  over  the  tunnel  may  be  used  to  reduce  the thickness  of  any needed protective fill. The composition of fill placed  over the tunnel shall be such that pressure from sunken  ships and falling anchors is cushioned to reduce the risk  of damage to the structure below, and shall be confirmed  by analysis.

Anchor release bands have typically been located   16 feet clear of the tunnel.   contain materials such as rubble rock, masonry, or metal  without prior agreement from the designer and Owner.   Where fill materials are subject to scour or erosion,  for  example  by  waves,  currents,  and/or  propeller  wash,  the  uppermost  layer  of  fill  (scour  protection)  shall  be  designed to prevent scour and erosion.   It  may  be  appropriate  to  provide  anchor  release  bands  against  dragging  anchors  in  locations  where  extreme conditions can arise such that ships could drag  anchors that would snag on the tunnel.    Placing  fill  above  the  natural  bed  of  the  waterway  should be avoided unless proven that negative hydrologic  or environment consequences will not occur.   8.4.1.4—Sideslopes   Sideslopes  for  underwater  excavations  shall  be  designed  in  accordance  with  Section  11  of  the  LRFD  Specifications. Cut slopes design shall consider potential  impact  on  ground  displacements  and  displacement  of  existing  structures,  utilities,  and  facilities  within  the  influence of construction. The design shall ensure that the  sides  and  bottom  of  any  excavation  are  stable.  Designs  shall take into account excavation base stability against  heave  and  softening  in  any  cohesive  soils  during  and  subsequent  to  construction.  Designs  shall  take  into  account  the  expected  external  surcharge  loads  due  to  existing or proposed structures, traffic, and Contractor’s  equipment and material stockpiles.   the   The location of existing features and conditions shall  be  verified  when  determining  inclination  of  sideslopes of the trench excavation for placement of the  immersed  tunnel  elements.  Existing  features  such  as  utility  lines,  bridges,  and  other  marine  structures’  foundations shall be located to ensure that the sideslope  will not affect the exiting feature. Existing features such  as riprap scour protection, temporary supports that were  used  during  the  construction  of  existing  facilities  but  were left in place and other features shall be identified,  located, and accommodated in the design.   Underwater cut slopes shall neither be steeper than 2  Horizontal  to  1  Vertical  in  soil  nor  steeper  than  1  Horizontal to 4 Vertical in rock in areas where utility lines  and marine structures are located within the influence of  tunnel  construction,  provided  the  provisions  of  Section  11 of the LRFD Specifications are met.   The Contractor shall be responsible for the design of   temporary sideslopes excavated for element placement.   The  design  of  underwater  slopes  shall  evaluate  the  influence  of  the  slope  angle  on  the  rate  of  sediment  deposition  in  the  excavated  trench  and  its  potential  impact to the foundation preparation.   8.4.2—Materials   See Section 4 for materials.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

This  design  consideration  is  unique  to  immersed  tunnels  and  can  result  from  construction  practices.  Support  loss  shall  include  loss  of  support  (subsidence)  uniformly below the tunnel or to only one side. For the  immersed tunnel, a loss of support of 30 feet over the full  width of the tunnel element at any point along the length  of the element shall be considered. Uneven support shall  be  considered  also  as  follows:  zero  at  one  side  of  the  element transitioning to full support on the opposite side  of  the  element  for  a  length  of  30  feet  along  the  longitudinal axis of the tunnel.    8.5—CONSTRUCTION   8.5.1—Shipping Channel Traffic   C8.5.1   The   requirements   for  maintenance   of   marine traffic may dictate the following:   • maximum element lengths • • •  location of immersion joints construction sequencing dredging  of  temporary  channels  to  detour marine traffic around the active construction site time restrictions on construction activities  •  Typically, a Notice to Mariners must be issued by  the  responsible  authority  well  in  advance  of  the  occupation of such areas. Changes at short notice to the  dates of occupation may not be possible.   There  will  be  an  impact  on  shipping  movements  during  dredging,  placing  the  tunnel  elements  and  during fill operations, all of which require specialised  equipment. Standby vessels may be required to protect  work areas from errant vessels. Proper coordination has  made it possible to construct immersed tunnels in even  the busiest and in the narrowest of waterways.   The  design  of  immersed  tunnels  shall  take  into  account the maintenance of marine traffic, and establish  the  criteria  for  maintenance  of  marine  traffic  during  construction at the early stages of design.    Areas  required  for  marine  construction  operations  such  as  excavation,  foundation  preparation,  immersion,  and filling shall be clearly marked so that shipping traffic  is excluded from such areas.   8.5.2—Trench Excavation   Excavations  shall  be  designed  to  be  cut  at  an  appropriate  slope or  structurally  supported, as  required,  based  on  ground  conditions  and  site  constraints.  Structural excavation support systems shall be designed  in accordance with recognized design procedures.   The  design  of  temporary  structural  support  of  excavation  required  for  trench  excavation  shall  be  the  responsibility of the Contractor.   The tunnel trench minimum widths shall be shown  on the drawings. The width shall be sufficient to ensure  working  room  for  divers  to  safely  work  and  to  ensure  proper backfilling of elements.   The Contractor shall be responsible for verifying that  the bottom width of the excavation is sufficient to ensure  the safety of divers and other workers.   Cut  slopes  shall  meet   the   requirements  of   Article 8.4.1.4.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  All rights reserved.

Constructability shall be considered  in determining element lengths. Loadings dependent on  element length shall be checked for each length used in  the design.    The  final  selection  of  element  lengths  shall  be  the  responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor shall be  responsible  for  performing  the  design  and  checks  required to ensure that the final structure is adequate for  both  permanent  loads  and  temporary  loads  imposed  during  construction  utilizing  the  selected  elements  and  the Contractor’s proposed means and methods.   Many  elements  have  been  between  300  and  400  feet long and some have been up to twice that length.  The actual length of an element may be governed by  the  available  size  of  the  fabrication  facility,  the  navigable channel along the waterway used to float the  elements  to  the  construction  site,  ability  of  available  tug  boats  to  handle  the  element,  marine  traffic,  currents,  wave  height  during  tow,  element  shape,  vertical  profile  and  horizontal  alignment,  outfitting  facility size and location, and placing barge equipment.  The  length  of  a  tunnel  element  usually  only  affects  schedule, not methodology.   8.5.4—Fabrication Facility   C8.5.4   One or more potential fabrication facilities shall be  identified as part of the design. Assumptions relative to  the  location,  size,  and  configuration  of  the  fabrication  facility shall be included in the contract documents.   The final selection of the location and configuration  of the fabrication facility shall be the responsibility of the  Contractor.   The  selection  and  choice  of  sites  for  a  tunnel  requires  facility   element  consideration of at least the following factors:   fabrication   typically   •  Distance from the tunnel site  •  Availability over required period of use  •  Navigational access  •  Effects on marine traffic  •  Land access  •  Overall suitability for construction of steel or   concrete tunnel elements  •  Geotechnical conditions  •  Environmental impact  •  Archaeological interests   temporary  casting  basin  using   Fabrication facilities have been located both above  and below water level. Below water level, a dry dock  or  removable  cofferdams  might  be  used.  In  most  instances,  the  choice is between the use of a purpose-built basin or of  an existing dry dock. As with shipyards, dry docks are  usually committed to ship repair orders well in advance  and could be expensive to lease.    8.5.5—Transportation    C8.5.5   Stability shall be checked while a tunnel element is  afloat,  including  all  marine  operations.  Due  attention  shall  be  paid  to  effects  of  variations  in  structural  dimensions, including results of thermal and hydrostatic  effects. Items to consider shall include:    •  Sufficient  freeboard  for  marine  operations,  so  that  tunnel  elements  are  relatively  unaffected  even  when  waves run over the top. A factor of safety exceeding  1.01 is recommended to guard against sinking due to  variations  in  both  the  tunnel  dimensions  and  in  the  densities  of  tunnel  materials  and  the  surrounding  water.    •  Lateral stability of the element using cross-curves of  stability analysis shall have a factor of safety in excess   The  distance  of  the  facility  from  the  tunnel  alignment is preferably short, but many elements have  been fabricated hundreds or thousands of miles away  and towed across open oceans. If built on the alignment  of  the  approaches,  towing  distances  are  practically  eliminated.    Tunnel elements have been towed on submersible  barges  or  floating  on  their  own.  The  transportation  methods may depend on the route and distance between  the fabrication facility and the construction site.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

See  Figure 8.5.5-1.   Figure 8.5.5-1—Right and Heeling Moments   The righting moment is calculated from centroids of  weight and displacement as the structure is rotated. The  heeling  moment  is  calculated  from  what  is  causing  the  heel to occur, e.g. concrete blocks placed along one edge,  towers,  loads  on  exposed  structure  (survey  wind  freeboard, etc.). Downflooding angle may not be relevant  if the structure is sealed.     Special measures may be required to control tunnel  elements  in  areas  with  currents  or  navigation  channels  and when storms occur.    Navigation lights and sufficient monitoring shall be   provided to maintain the elements in safe condition.   Tunnel elements may be constructed in batches or in  a sequence that does not permit immediate outfitting and  laying. It may be necessary to store elements temporarily  afloat  for  a  period  that  could  even  be  months.  The  location shall be chosen to satisfy the following criteria:   It  is  recommended  that  an  emergency  berth  be  identified  for  tunnel  elements,  preferably  within  or  close to the placement site.    If individual moorings are used, then each element  would  require  large  swing  circles.  The  total  area  required can be reduced by using moorings at both ends  of each element.   Bottom suitable for anchoring   Sheltered location   •  Adequate water depth  •  •  •  Away from shipping channels  •   Sufficient space between elements such that  they cannot collide  •  Maintenance accessibility   8.5.6—Outfitting   C8.5.6   Tunnel elements shall be designed to withstand force  effects  associated  with  outfitting  performed  after  being  floated. Unequal loadings due to addition of permanent  or temporary ballast, structure components, or ancillary  items shall be analyzed and checked.   External ballast shall not be capable of being scoured  away or falling off, e.g. concrete or blocks, or else stone  or gravel retained to prevent displacement.   Potential  locations  for  element  outfitting  shall  be   identified during the design process.   Determination of the final outfitting location(s) shall  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Contractor.  The  Contractor  shall  also  be  responsible  for  performing  the  analysis  required to ensure that the outfitting process selected will  not damage the element.   Depending upon how complete a tunnel element is  once it is afloat, some outfitting or further construction  may  be  required  before  leaving  the  vicinity  of  the  fabrication facility.   One or more outfitting locations often in the vicinity  of the final alignment are required to complete at least  the primary structure of an incomplete tunnel element,  perhaps add some ballast either internally or externally,  and to add temporary immersion equipment.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The  purpose  of  these  checks  is  to  ensure  the  stability,  including  control  over  the  tunnel  element,  while  it  is  lowered to its final position.    The  value  of  112.5  kips  has  been  developed  through experience with the construction of immersed  tunnels and is not based on research.   To  lower  an  element  to  its  final  position,  either  a  temporary ballasting system shall be used or the element  weight  shall  be  such  that  the  element  will  itself  have  sufficient negative buoyancy. If temporary water ballast  is used, the water shall be assumed to be fresh water, not  saline.    The  following  checks  shall  be  made  for  the   immersion process:    •  The total factored resisting force effect immediately  after lowering shall be calculated in accordance with  Section  3.7.  The  buoyancy  load  shall  be  calculated  based on the mean high tide at the tunnel location.  •  The  total  factored  resisting  force  effect  within  four  hours  of  lowering  shall  be  calculated  in  accordance  with  Section  3.7.  The  buoyancy  load  shall  be  calculated based on the average high wave height at  the  tunnel  location.  Stricter  requirements  may  be  imposed in busy shipping channels.   •  A vertical downward load of not less than 112.5 kips  shall  be  maintained  on  every  temporary  bed-level  support, if used, until the element is placed on its final  foundation.   •  When  making  the  above  checks,  the  weight  of  immersion  equipment,  temporary  connections,  and  temporary ballast shall not be taken into account.  •  When making the above checks, the effect of adjacent  elements in place shall not be taken into account.   The  Contractor  shall be  responsible for  making  the  checks  required  by  this  section.  Additional  checks  that  may be required shall be performed by the Contractor.   Tunnel  elements  shall  be  installed  at  an  elevation  considering an allowance for settlement, such that after  completion of the foundation works and all filling, they  will be expected to be located within the specified lateral  and vertical tolerances.    The  Contractor  shall  be  responsible  for  performing  the  analysis  required  to  verify  that  settlement  after  the  lowering  and  backfilling  of  an  element  will  not  have  a  detrimental effect on the element.   The  tunnel  shall  be  released  from  any  temporary  supports onto its foundation prior to placing fill over the  tunnel.   8.5.8—Joining and Backfilling   C8.5.8   Backfilling shall occur in a manner that does not cause  differential  loads  on  opposite  sides  of  elements  or  immersion joints.   Force effects applied to the elements during joining  and  backfilling  shall  be  determined  and  checked  under  Service II.   For  design  purposes,  it  shall  be  assumed  that  backfilling will occur simultaneously on both sides of an   A typical joint between elements includes:   •  Temporary watertight bulkheads (dam plates);   •  Temporary  watertight  access  doors   in   the   bulkheads;    •  Permanent joint seals or gaskets;   •  Temporary  dewatering  equipment  including  any   pumps and piping;    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Extreme  Event  T-III—Immersed  tunnel  elements  shall be investigated for a rare event for the simultaneous  combination  of  loads  such  as  flooding.  This  load  combination shall be used for both surface flooding that  raises  the  ground  water  elevation  or  the  level  of  open  water, and for flooding of the inside of the tunnel.  The  following flooding cases shall be investigated under this  limit state:   • Sea  level  or  surface  water  elevations  rise  that produces  increased  hydrostatic  pressures  on  the tunnel and reduces the resistance to buoyancy, and • Flooding of the inside of the tunnel that increases the resistance  to  buoyancy  and  reduces  the  hydrostatic pressure to zero.  8.6.5—Load Factors and Load Combinations   Immersed tunnel elements shall be designed for the   load combinations shown in Table 3.4-1.   8.6.6—Resistance Factors   See Section 4 for material resistance factors.   Resistance factors for buoyancy shall be as follows:   Immediately after immersion:  6 hours after immersion:  Permanent condition:   0.975  0.960  0.900   If the element is submerged in a public waterway, the  resistance factor for buoyancy may be increased to 0.98  for short periods after immersion only under controlled  conditions.   8.7—GENERAL FEATURES OF DESIGN   8.7.1—Loading   This article supplements Section 3 with information   unique to immersed tunnels.   8.7.1.1—Permanent Loads   The   following  provides  design   information  for permanent loads unique to immersed tunnels.

For  an  element  on  temporary  supports  after  immersion,  one  temporary  support  may  settle  more  than  another.  Fixing  an  immersion  joint  (removing  a  degree  of  freedom  using  shear  keys,  for  example)  also  changes  subsequent  behavior.  Short-term  settlements  may  occur after placing an element due to compaction of the  foundation layer.   Selection  of  a  more  favorable  fabrication  site,  improvement  of  poor  soils,  proper  preparation  of  the  foundation  and  planned  placement  of  fill  can  reduce  settlement effects.    For a typical immersed tunnel, the effective weight   of the structure is less than the soil it is replacing.    Structures  shall  be  designed  to  accommodate  both  short-term  and  long-term  settlements.  Where  uneven  settlements on a foundation may occur, structures shall be  designed  to  accommodate  the  resulting  stresses.  The  effects  of  placing  fill  on  or  around  an  element  or  on  adjacent  elements  shall  be  taken  into  account;  lateral  movements  can  occur  in  soils  that  are  non-uniform  laterally and where the soil surface is sloping. Anticipated  variations in soil properties shall be taken into account in  analyses. Ground and structure settlement due to applied  loads,  dewatering,  excavations,  tunneling,  pile  driving,  and  other  construction  activities  shall  be  estimated  in  designs,  using  generally  recognized  procedures  and  methods  of  analysis.  Analyses  shall  be  performed  to  estimate  foundation  rebound  due  to  excavation  of  the  overburden soils and the recompression of the foundation  soils due to placement of the tunnel and backfill material.  Settlement  analyses  shall  consider  compression  of  the  foundation  course  placed  beneath  the  tunnel  elements.  Analyses  shall  also  be  performed  to  estimate  the  longitudinal and transverse differential settlement within  each  tunnel  element,  differential  settlement  between  adjoining tunnel elements, and differential settlement at  the  transitions  at  the  ends  of  the  immersed  tunnel.  Measures shall be taken to prevent sharp transitions from  soil to rock foundations, such that the tunnel structure is  reinforced  to  accommodate  the  stresses  arising  or  to  mitigate the effects of sharp transitions. Alternatively, the  tunnel structure shall be reinforced to accommodate the  stresses arising or shall be designed to mitigate the effects  of sharp transitions.   8.7.1.2—Transient Loads  The  following  provides  design  information  for  transient loads unique to immersed tunnels. Refer also to  Section 3 for transient loads.   8.7.1.2.1—Transient Water Loads (WAp)  C8.7.1.2.1   Such  variations  are  caused  by  tides,  storms,   tsunamis, large waves, etc.    This load represents the effects of variations in water  level  above  and  below  MSL  (mean  sea  level).  At  least  two water levels shall be considered: For Strength I, the  water  level  shall  have  an  annual  probability  of  being  exceeded of 0.2 or greater, and for Extreme Event limit  states, water levels with a probability of being exceeded  once during the design life. The effects of global warming  and  rise  or  fall  of  the  land  mass  shall  be  taken  into  account. Where pore water pressure relief is not provided  from  beneath  an  immersed  tunnel,  then  passing  ships,  seismic  events,  and  the  troughs  of  tsunamis  and  large  waves can result in pore water pressure beneath the tunnel  tending to lift the tunnel. Both maximum and minimum  hydrostatic loads shall be used for structural calculations  as appropriate to the member being designed.

The effect of suspended material  shall  be  taken  into  account  in  determining  the  specific  gravity of water.   In the absence of better data, global warming may be   assumed to result in a two-foot rise in MSL.   8.7.1.3—Construction Loads   The strength and stability of tunnel elements, and all  components,  shall  be  ensured  at  every  stage  of  construction, especially when afloat.    The determination of the magnitude of construction  loads and the analysis of immersed tunnel elements for  construction  loading  shall  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Contractor.    8.7.1.3.1—Launching (LA)   C8.7.1.3.1   Loads occurring during launching or flooding of a  dry facility shall be analyzed to ensure that no damage  will occur to the element.   Where  elements  are  ballasted  down  during  the  flooding of  a dry  facility,  for reasons of  control,  it  is  advisable  to  float  one  end  up  before  the  other  when  “launching.”   8.7.1.3.2—Transportation (TR)   C8.7.1.3.2   During  towing  and  mooring,  sufficient  freeboard  shall  exist  so  that  tunnel  elements  are  relatively  unaffected  even  when  waves  run  over  the  top.  When  elements are constructed on or transported by barge, they  shall  be designed  for  possible  static  and dynamic  loads  those  occurring  under  storm  conditions  including  according to barge location.   When  a  storm  warning  is  issued,  or  forecast  wave  heights  are  expected  to  exceed  operational  limits,  all  marine  operations  shall  be  ceased  temporarily;  marine  plant and floating tunnel elements shall be sent to their  designated storm moorings or shelters. It is recommended  that an emergency berth be identified for tunnel elements,  preferably within or close to the placement site. Special  measures may be required to control tunnel elements in  areas with currents or navigation channels.   Temporary  prestressing  to  hold  segment  joints  closed during transportation shall be sufficient to ensure  that tensile stresses in joints do not occur.   Were  joints  to  open,  slamming  could  damage  joints  when  they  close  and  joint  seals  could  be  permanently damaged.   8.7.1.3.3—Immersion (IN)   C8.7.1.3.3   Attachments  on  an  element  that  are  used  to  lower  elements during immersion shall be designed using a load  factor of 2.0. Typically, four such attachments are used.  The design load for the attachments shall assume that the  lowering equipment fails or breaks at any one attachment.  The  design  load  shall  also  consider  possible  dynamic  loads  cause  by  wind  and  wave  action  resulting  in  differential  motion  between  the  element  and  the  lay  barge, etc., from which it is suspended.    Where  immersion  is  carried  out  by  a  jack-up  or  other  platform  resting  on  ground,  or  by  a  shore- mounted crane, wave action on the element may cause  significant loads on lowering equipment.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

As part of the joining process, temporary equipment  may  be  used  to  assist  in  aligning  an  element  to  the  previously  placed  element  (horn  beams  at  the  inboard  end,  cables  attached  to  the  remote  end,  wedges  in  the  joint, etc.). To assist in obtaining an initial seal of gaskets  in  the  immersion  joint,  some  form  of  jacks  or  other  pulling equipment, either attached to the elements or the  bulkheads, may be used to pull the elements together.   8.7.2—Joints   All  immersed  tunnel  joints  shall  be  watertight  throughout  the  design  life,  and  shall  accommodate  expected  movements  caused  by  differences  in  temperature,  creep,  settlement,  earthquake  motions,  method  of  construction,  etc.  Displacements  in  any  direction shall be limited so that the waterproof limits of  a joint are not exceeded.   Joint  shear  capability  shall  take  into  account  the  influence of normal forces and bending moments on the  shear  capacity  of  the  section.  The  design  shall  take  account of shear forces generated where the faces of the  joints are not normal to the tunnel axis.   Joints shall be ductile, in addition to accommodating  longitudinal movements. Tension ties may be required to  limit movement so that joints do not leak or break open,  especially during a seismic event.   The  axial  compression  of  tunnel  elements  and  bulkheads  due  to  depth  of  immersion,  as  well  as  temperature  effects,  shall  be  taken  into  account  in  determining joint dimensions at installation. The effects  of higher or lower internal air pressure in sealed tunnel  elements  due  to  variations  in  temperature,  etc.,  due  to  compression,  expansion,  and  immersion  shall  be  taken  into account.   The design of primary flexible seals at tunnel joints   shall be designed to take into account:   • Maximum  deviations  of   the  supporting  frames  relative to their design location  • Maximum deviation of the planes of the frames • Relaxation of the seal • A capacity of at least a further 0.4 in. of compression • The  minimum  compression  shall  be  0.4  in.  greater than the compression required to maintain a seal  A secondary seal capable of carrying the full water pressure shall be fitted across each immersion joint.

In the event that an initial seal is not obtained after  immersion and joining, the joint shall be designed so that  a backup method of obtaining an initial seal is available.   8.7.3—Scour Protection   Scour  protection  shall  be  placed  over  the  tunnel  backfill in areas where wave and current scour can occur  and  where  scour  from  ship  propeller  wash  is  likely  to  occur.

The method of placing this material shall  ensure  that  larger  sized  stones  do  not  penetrate  the  general  backfill  and  shall  not  cause  damage  to  the  waterproofing of the tunnel (if used). The protection layer  shall not be placed by bottom dumping.   8.8—STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS   C8.8   Structural analysis shall be as specified in Section 4  of  the  LRFD  Specifications,  where  a  number  of  permissible  analysis  methods  are  described.

Other  methods   For  steel  immersed  tunnels  analyzed  using  the  same structural model, the efficiency of any curvature  of  the  steel  members  will  not  be  fully  utilized.  Most  general  purpose  structural  analysis  programs  have  routines  based  on  these  principles  for  dimensional  models.   It  may  be  appropriate  to  use  two-  or  three-  dimensional finite element analyses to model the tunnel  in  both  the  transverse  and  longitudinal  directions,  especially  for  steel  tunnels.  Finite  element  models  identify load sharing, account for secondary effects and  identify load paths. Steel immersed tunnel elements are  complex assemblies of plates that might be curved, and  have  stiffeners  and  diaphragms.  Simplifying  these  systems  to  the  point  where  classical  methods  of  analysis can be used may undermine the efficient use  of materials that can result from complex load paths.    Some designers design for crack widths less than  or equal to 0.006 in. notwithstanding the considerable  increase in reinforcement required.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Some  segmental tunnels have omitted waterproofing.    External waterproofing for concrete tunnel elements  shall be considered. Notwithstanding the provision of a  membrane,  the  underlying  structural  concrete  shall  be  to  be  watertight.  The  materials  of  a  designed  waterproofing  system  shall  have  a  proven  resistance  to  the specific corrosive qualities of the surrounding waters  and  soils.  The  materials  of  the  system  shall  be  flexible  and strong enough to span any cracks that may develop  during the life of the structure. The waterproofing shall  preferably envelop the element where exposed to soil and  water.   For steel tunnels, the outer steel membrane may act   as a waterproofing membrane.    For steel waterproofing membranes used on concrete  or  steel  elements,  either  an  appropriate  corrosion  protection  system  shall  be  used  to  ensure  that  the  minimum design thickness is maintained during the life  of the facility, or an added sacrificial thickness shall be  provided. Nonstructural steel membranes shall be no less  than 1/4 in. thick and shall be watertight. Steel plates shall  be joined using continuous butt welds. All welds shall be  inspected  and  tested  for  soundness  and  tested  for  watertightness.   Bituminous membranes shall not be used.  The waterproofing system shall preferably adhere at  every point to the surfaces to which it is applied so that,  if  perforated  at  any  one  location,  water  cannot  travel  under it to another. The areas of free water flow between  a non-adhering membrane and the underlying concrete in  case of leakage shall be limited to no more than 100 ft².  Depending  upon  the  type  of  waterproofing  used,  protection on the sides and top of the tunnel elements may  be required to ensure that it remains undamaged during  all  operations  up  to  final  placement  and  during  subsequent backfilling operations.   8.9.2—Water Infiltration   C8.9.2   Groundwater  infiltration  shall  be  limited  to  0.002   gal/ft²/day.   No dripping or visible leakage from a single location   shall be permitted.  The allowable water infiltration value is based on  criteria obtained from the International Tunneling and  Underground  Space  Association  (ITA),  Singapore’s  Land  Transport  Authority  (LTA),  Singapore’s  Public  Utilities Board (PUB), Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Rail  Corporation  the  German  Cities  Committee, as well as criteria used by various projects  in the United States and others abroad for both highway  and transit tunnels.

The initial ground support is designed for these specific  ground conditions.    This Section provides guidance for the selection and  specifications for the design of initial support elements  for  conventionally  mined  and  tunnel  boring  machine- mined  (TBM)  tunnels  in  soft  ground,  mixed  face,  and  rock  conditions.  The  specifications  in  this  Section  are  for construction that is considered temporary in that it is  not accounted for as part of the permanent load carrying  elements  of  the  final  tunnel  structure.  In  general,  the  elements  covered  under  this  section  are  considered  sacrificial.  This  Section  also  discusses  various  ground  improvement  methods  that  may  be  used  in  support  of  tunnel excavation operations.   The design of initial ground support for mined and  bored  tunnels  may  be  performed  by  the  Engineer.  Alternately,  a  performance  specification  may  be  developed  by  the  Engineer  whereby  the  Contractor  selects means and methods for initial support systems.  However,  since  actual  reaches  of  specific  ground  conditions will likely vary from what is included in the  contract  documents,  during  construction  the  ground  condition  is  identified  at  the  site  and  the  appropriate  initial ground support is installed.   This Section does not address support of excavation   for open-cut construction.   9.2—DEFINITIONS   Face Bolt—Reinforcement placed to support and limit inward movement of face between rounds. Typically Glass  Reinforced Plastic (GRP) to prevent damage to drilling and cutting tools.   Friction Rock Stabilizer—A rock reinforcement element which develops load resistance from frictional contact with  the drill hole surface; functions effectively as a dowel.   Heading—The leading edge of the tunnel excavation.   One-Pass Precast Concrete Segmental Lining—Full perimeter precast concrete segmental lining with connectors and  gaskets installed concurrently with mining by TBM. This lining functions as the permanent tunnel structure as well as  the temporary support; a single-shell lining.   Pattern  Rock  Reinforcement—Rock  reinforcement  installed  on  a  fixed  longitudinal  and  transverse  spacing  and  intended to function as a unit with the ground, to mobilize the self-support of the ground through arch action or beam  building.   Permanent Support—A type of support with a service life equal to the service life of the tunnel, which can be relied  upon as part of the final tunnel structure; forms part of a “double-shell lining;” permanent support requires protection  against corrosion.   Rock/Ground Anchor—A tensioned rock reinforcement element with a much larger load capacity than a rock bolt;  often installed for permanent use, with special corrosion protection.   Rock Bolt—A tensioned rock reinforcement element.   Rock Dowel—An untensioned rock reinforcement element.   Rock Quality Designation (RQD)—A measure of rock mass integrity based on the condition of rock core samples.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Rock Surface Protection—Material installed to prevent fallout or raveling of ground exposed in the tunnel excavation  perimeter between rock reinforcement elements. Rock surface protection may include chain link fencing, welded wire  fabric, Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) fabric and thin shotcrete membranes. Steel channel sections or mine straps  (thin flexible sheet steel members with pre-punched holes) are often used with rock surface protection.   Self-Drilling Anchor—A reinforcement element with a sacrificial bit for installation in drill holes that may collapse  or otherwise be blocked before conventional reinforcement elements can be installed.    Spile—A pre-reinforcement element generally installed around the perimeter of the tunnel and extending beyond the  temporary excavation face; used to increase ground stand-up time to facilitate installation of initial support.   Spot Rock Reinforcement—Rock reinforcement installed intermittently as required or directed to supplement pattern  rock reinforcement or to support isolated rock wedges.   Stand-Up Time—Amount of time that an unsupported heading or excavation face (length and span) will stand before  the ground begins to move into the excavation. Stand-up time varies from indefinite for strong, intact, self-supporting  rock to minutes in weak ground.   Steel Rib—A steel shape expanded to full perimeter contact with the rock in tunnels mined by TBM or erected tightly  against the rock with timber blocking in conventional mined excavations.   Two-Pass  Precast  Concrete  Segmental  Lining—Full  perimeter  precast  concrete  segmental  lining  installed  concurrently with mining by TBM. A “secondary lining” of cast-in-place concrete or shotcrete is constructed inside  the segmental lining. The two distinct systems form a “double-shell lining.”   9.3—NOTATION   9.3.1—General   A  B  c  F  ko  l  M  N  w  W  \\uf06a   =  Area of sliding surface (ft2) (9.7.1.1)  =  Load bearing capacity of bolt (dowel) (ksf) (9.7.1.1)  =  Cohesion of sliding surface (ksf) (9.7.1.1)  =  Safety factor (9.7.1.1)  =  Horizontal stress ratio (A9.2.2)  =  Center to center spacing between ribs (ft) (9.7.3)  =  Bending moment (kip-ft); Distance between supports (ft) (9.7.3)  =  Number of bolts (dowels) (9.7.1.1)  =  Ground load with appropriate load factor applied (kip/ft) (9.7.3)  =  Weight of wedge (kip) (9.7.1.1)  =  Friction angle of sliding surface (9.7.1.1)   9.3.2—Abbreviations   ACI:  DEM:  ft:  GBR:  GDM:  GDR:  GRP:  ksf:  RMR:  RQD:  SDA:  SEM:  SFRS:  TBM:   American Concrete Institute   Distinct Element Method  Foot/feet  Geotechnical baseline report  Geotechnical design memoranda  Geotechnical data report  Glass reinforced plastic  kips per square foot  Geomechanics classification  Rock quality designation  Self drilling anchor  Sequential excavation method  Steel fiber reinforced shotcrete  Tunnel boring machine   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

SEM  excavation  in  rock  may  include  use  of  controlled blasting methods, excavation by roadheader, and  excavation by various types of mechanical rock excavation  equipment,  such  as  impact  hammers,  as  appropriate  to  ground conditions observed in the excavations.   improvement  methods   in  support  of   See Section 5 for recommended GDR content and for   guidance for GDM format and content.   9.4.1.2—Rock Conditions   C9.4.1.2   The information in this article applies to various rock  classes  defined  by  the  Engineer  in  the  Geotechnical  Baseline Report (GBR), which generally shall be prepared  in  parallel  with  the  GDM.  Occasionally,  special  water  control measures may be required. Requirements for such  measures will be discussed in the GDM.   Generally,  four  rock  classes  shall  be  anticipated  for  most  tunnel design projects. For  special  situations, a fifth  class may be developed. For tunnel projects with uniform  rock  conditions,  no  more  than  two  rock  classes  may  be  required.    The rock classes shall be identified by the Engineer in  the GBR. Each class also may be readily identified during  tunnel excavation by direct visual observation by a trained  geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist prior to the  installation of support elements.   Information  regarding  recommended  software  for the design of initial support for rock can be found  in Appendix 9-A.   (fracture)  spacing  and   The  classes  are  differentiated  on  the  basis  of  joint  the  degree  of  decomposition and weathering of the rock mass. The  behavior of each class in response to excavation and  the development of load on the initial support and the  permanent  tunnel  lining  are  determined  principally  by these factors.    Each  rock  class  can  be  differentiated  on  the  basis of information contained in the boring logs and  the  results  of  field  and  laboratory  testing.  This  information can be found in the project Geotechnical  Data Report (GDR).    Each of the rock classes shall be defined as follows:   Rock Class I—Fresh intact rock with a joint/fracture  spacing  in  excess  of  6  ft.  Joints/fractures  are  very  widely  spaced, with very widely spaced clusters of very closely to  closely  spaced  fractures.  Slickensided  fractures  are  very  rare.  Mineralization  along  joints/fractures  is  rare  and  few  infilled  joints/fractures  are  observed.  Joint  surfaces  descriptions can be found in Table C5.5.4-1.   Rock  Class  I—This  material  generally  would  exhibit  a  Rock  Quality  Designation  (RQD)  greater  than 85. It would be classified as Rock Condition 1  to  3  in  Table  C5.5.4-1.

For  tunnel  excavations  greater  than  25  ft  in  width,  generally  characteristic  of  road  tunnels,  sequential  excavation  of  multiple  drifts  is  recommended. Round lengths up to 12 ft are feasible  for  mined  excavations  using  controlled  blasting  or  roadheader excavation.   This material generally can be supported by spot  rock  reinforcement  or  pattern  rock  reinforcement,  with  longitudinal  and  transverse  spacing  between  rock reinforcement elements of five to six ft in both  conventionally  mined  tunnels  and  TBM-mined  tunnels.    Pattern  rock  reinforcement  often  is  used  in  TBM-mined  tunnels  in  conditions  where  spot  reinforcement  might  be  used  in  conventionally  mined  tunnels.  The  reason  is  that  wedges  that  normally  would  be  dislodged  by  vibration  or  gas  pressures  when  explosive  excavation  is  used  may  remain  in  place  for  an  indeterminate  period  before  falling  without  warning  along  the  length  of  the  tunnel.   rock   Occasional  use  of  rock  surface  protection  between  is  reinforcement  recommended to prevent  fallout  of  small blocks or  raveling  of  the  excavation  perimeter.  Rock  surface  protection does not need to be installed concurrently  with installation of rock reinforcement.   elements   Rock  Class  II—Typically  slightly  weathered  rock  with  a  joint  spacing  from  2  to  6  ft.  Shear/fault  planes,  joint/fracture  weathering  and  alteration  products  may  be  present  in  this  rock  class.  Open,  infilled  and  slickensided  fractures  are  easily  observed.  Observed  shear/fault  planes  can  contain  clay  or  disintegrated  rock  between  rock  surfaces, with a  thickness of alteration products generally  less  than  six  in.  The  rock  mass  contains  distinct  sub- domains of lower quality rock characterized by clusters of  very  closely  to  closely  spaced  fractures  and  persistent  infilled fractures.   Rock Class II—This material generally would  exhibit an RQD ranging between 75 and 85. It would  be  classified  as  Rock  Condition  3  or  4  in  Table  C5.5.4-1. Standup time in mined tunnels is generally  greater  than  8  hours  but  less  than  24  hours  in  this  rock  class  for  excavations  less  than  about  25  ft  in  width.    For  tunnel  excavations  greater  than  25  ft  in  width,  generally  characteristic  of  highway  tunnels,  sequential  excavation  of  multiple  drifts  is  recommended.  Round  lengths  up  to  8  to  10  ft  are  feasible  for  mined  excavations  using  controlled  blasting or roadheader excavation.   This  material  generally  can  be  supported  by  pattern  rock  reinforcement,  with  longitudinal  and  transverse  spacing  between  rock  reinforcement  elements  of  4 to  5 ft  in both  conventionally  mined  tunnels and TBM-mined tunnels. Use of rock surface  protection  between  rock  reinforcement  elements  is  recommended to prevent  fallout  of  small blocks or  raveling  of  the  excavation  perimeter.  Rock  surface  protection may need to be installed concurrently with  installation of rock reinforcement.   Rock  Class  III—Typically,  moderately  weathered  rock  with  a  joint/fracture  spacing  of  less  than  2  ft,  or  multiple  and  random  joint/fracture  sets  with  smooth  or  slickensided surfaces, irrespective of joint/fracture spacing,  or multiple zones of brecciated and heavily fractured rock  with clay or disintegrated between rock surfaces or one or   Rock Class III—This material generally would  exhibit an RQD ranging between 50 and 75.

This  material  generally  can  be  supported  by  pattern  rock  reinforcement,  with  longitudinal  and  transverse  spacing  between  rock  reinforcement  elements of 3 to 4 ft. Use of Self Drilling Anchors  (SDA)  may  be  recommended  if  there  are  concerns  with drill hole stability.    Use  of  rock  surface  protection  between  rock  reinforcement elements is recommended to prevent  fallout of small blocks or raveling of the excavation  perimeter.  Rock  surface  protection  generally  may  need to be installed concurrently with installation of  rock reinforcement.   Alternatively, this material can be supported by  steel ribs using steel, timber, or concrete lagging and  by  lattice  girders  with  shotcrete.  Supplemental  installation of rock reinforcement or SDAs may be  necessary  if  an  alternative  support  methodology  is  used.   Rock Class IV—Typically a shear zone or fault with  multiple zones of brecciated and heavily fractured rock with  clay  or  disintegrated  rock  between  rock  surfaces  with  conditions  varying  markedly  over  short  distances.  Water  control can be a significant issue since water may be trapped  in  a  shear  zone.  Use  of  various  ground  improvement  methods  installed  around  the  excavation  perimeter  and  in  the excavation face may be necessary.   Rock Class IV—This material generally would  exhibit an RQD ranging between 10 and 50. It would  be  classified  as  Rock  Condition  5  or  6  in  Table   C5.5.4-1  of  this  Specification.  Stand-up  time  in  mined tunnels is generally less than 4 hours in this  rock class for excavations less about 25 ft in width,  unless  pre-reinforcement  such  as  spiles  is  installed  ahead of the face.    For  tunnel  excavations  greater  than  25  ft  in  width,  generally  characteristic  of  highway  tunnels,  sequential  excavation  of  multiple  drifts  is  recommended. Widths of individual drifts should be  limited  to  no  more  than  10  ft.  Round  lengths  no  greater  than  4  ft  are  recommended  for  mined  excavations.  Because  of  the  nature  of  the  material,  excavation  is  most  efficiently  performed  with  excavation  conventional  mechanical  equipment or by roadheader.   earth   This  material  is  excavated  using  the  SEM  and  supported  principally  with  lattice  girders  and  shotcrete.

These linings may be either a one-pass  precast  concrete  segmental  lining  or  a  two-pass  precast  concrete segmental lining with a cast-in-place concrete final  lining. See definitions in Article 9.2.    For  tunnels  excavated  by  SEM,  use  combinations  of  lattice  girders,  shotcrete,  bolts,  dowels,  or  self  drilling  anchors (SDAs). See definitions in Article 9.2.   Historically,  one-pass  systems  using  cast  iron,  ductile iron, or fabricated steel segments have been  used.  Two-pass  systems  using  steel  ribs  with  full  perimeter timber lagging as initial support and a cast- in-place concrete final lining also have been used.   For  tunnels  excavated  by  TBM,  using  either  one-pass or two-pass precast concrete segments, the  segments  generally  are  designed  for  the  worst  anticipated combined ground and water loads along  the tunnel alignment. It generally is not considered  economical  to  have  multiple  segment  designs,  principally for construction logistics reasons (having  the right segment type, at the right place, at the right  time).   For tunnels excavated by SEM, the Engineer has  the  option  of  designing  different  cast-in-place  concrete or shotcrete final linings for defined reaches  of  tunnel.  Generally,  the  internal  geometry  of  the  tunnel  remains  constant,  but  lining  thickness  and  reinforcement bar size and spacing can be adjusted  for different loading conditions.   9.4.2.2—Rock Conditions   C9.4.2.2   For  tunnels  excavated  using  conventional  mining  methods,  including  SEM,  use  bolts,  dowels,  friction  rock  stabilizers, SDAs, steel ribs, and lagging or lattice girders  and shotcrete. See definitions in Article 9.2.   For tunnels excavated by TBM, one-pass precast  concrete segmental linings are frequently used. Two- pass systems using precast concrete segments, steel  ribs,  and  lagging  and  rock  reinforcement  as  initial  support with a final lining of cast-in-place concrete  are  still  commonly  used  in  TBM-mined  tunnels  in  rock.   For TBM-mined tunnels using precast concrete  segments for support, segments generally of a single  design are used over the full length of the tunnel, for  the same reasons as in soft ground and  mixed face  tunnels.  The  most  unfavorable  loading  conditions  will govern the design.   9.5—INITIAL GROUND SUPPORT ELEMENTS   C9.5   Various  ground  support  elements  may  be  used  on  tunneling projects. They include the following basic types:   This article lists and discusses the elements most   commonly used for initial support.    \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7  Soil and rock reinforcement elements Lattice girders Shotcrete Steel ribs and lagging  Representative  element  material  properties  are  contained in Section 4.

Untensioned  soil  and  rock  reinforcement  elements  shall  be  defined  as  dowels.  High  capacity,  tensioned  soil  and  rock  reinforcement  elements  shall be defined as ground anchors.    Selection  of  products  shall  be  based  on  required  loadings  developed  by  the  Engineer.  Manufacturer  data  provides capacity information for individual products.   9.5.1.1—Steel Reinforcement Elements   C9.5.1.1   Steel  reinforcement  elements  shall  include  solid  and  hollow  bars.  Hollow  bars  used  with  a  sacrificial  drill  bit  shall be defined as SDAs.   Construction specifications shall include provisions for  pull  testing  of  a  minimum  percentage  of  installed  rock  reinforcement elements (both pre-production and a selected  number  of  production  elements)  and  requirements  for  replacement of elements that fail the test.   Various  types  of  anchorages  and  corrosion  protection methods are used with steel reinforcement  elements.  Anchorage  methods  include  mechanical  anchorage, resin grout anchorage, and cement grout  anchorage.  Corrosion  protection  methods  include  epoxy coating, galvanization, plastic sleeves, cement  grout, and resin grout.   Mechanical  anchorage  or  resin  anchorage  of  rock  bolts  is  almost  immediate.  Fast  set  resin  cartridges are used to develop the anchorage. Cement  grout anchorage requires time to develop, which is a  problem in certain ground conditions.   Conversely,  successful  installation  of  rock  reinforcement  elements  through  a  full  column  of  resin cartridges requires careful coordination of hole  diameter,  cartridge  diameter,  and  reinforcement  element  diameter  and  proper  rotation  and  thrust  of  the  reinforcement  element  to  rupture  the  resin  cartridge,  mix  the  resin  and  catalyst,  and  achieve  effective encapsulation of the reinforcement element  by the resin.   9.5.1.2—Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) Elements   C9.5.1.2   Glass reinforced plastic (GRP) reinforcement elements  shall  include  solid  and  hollow  bars,  similar  to  steel  reinforcement. Hollow GRP bars may be used as SDAs.   GRP elements use the same range of anchorage  types as steel reinforcement elements. However, the  reinforcement  element  material  is  itself  corrosion  resistant,  so  less  care  is  necessary  to  achieve  an  installation  resistant  to  long-term  corrosion.  GRP  elements  can  be  excavated  easily  by  TBM  or  roadheader,  without  damaging  the  excavation  equipment  and  often  are  used  for  temporary,  sacrificial installations.   9.5.1.3—Friction Rock Stabilizers   C9.5.1.3   Two basic types of friction rock stabilizers, the Swellex   type and the Split Set type, may be used.   These  friction  rock  stabilizers  originally  were  proprietary,  but  the  patents  have  expired  and  elements  of  both  types  are  now  available  from  multiple  manufacturers.  The  Swellex  type  is  a  hollow steel tube that is inserted in the drill hole and  inflated  under  high  water  pressure  (approximately   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The  Split Set  type is a  split  steel  tube  of  slightly  larger  diameter  than  the  drill  hole  that  is  forced  into  the  hole.   Friction  rock  stabilizers  have  limitations  on  capacity and require greater displacement to develop  their  anchor  loads  than  grouted  or  mechanical  elements.   9.5.2—Lattice Girders   C9.5.2   Lattice  girders  in various grades of  steel  and  in  GRP   may be used.   Lattice  girders  are  used  as  reinforcement  for  shotcrete. Lattice girders have minimal load carrying  capacity and are dependent upon the time-dependent  composite action of lattice girders and shotcrete.   9.5.3—Shotcrete   C9.5.3   Two spraying methods may be used, dry mix and wet  mix. The  shotcrete  mix  may  be  either  plain  shotcrete  or shotcrete  reinforced  with  steel  fibers  at  various  dosage levels  (Steel  Fiber  Reinforced  Shotcrete,  SFRS)  or polypropylene  fibers.  Plain  shotcrete  may  be  reinforced with welded wire fabric or reinforcing bars. GRP fabric and reinforcing  bars  may  also  be  used  as  reinforcement  for specific  applications.  Cement  may  be  partially  replaced with fly ash or silica fume. Accelerators and other additives may be included in the mix.  Certification  of  nozzlemen  shall  be  required  by  the  project construction specifications. The American Concrete  Institute  (ACI)  provides  requirements  for  certification  of  nozzlemen.   Quality of shotcrete is operator dependent, even  when a robotic (remote) applicator is used. Attention  to detail during shotcrete application is essential for  a quality product.    9.5.4—Steel Ribs and Lagging   C9.5.4   Steel  ribs  shall consist of  conventional  rolled  shapes.  They  may  be  used  with  timber  or  steel  lagging. Steel  lagging  may  be  steel  channel  sections,  steel  liner  plate  bolted  to  the  web  of  the  rib,  specially  fabricated  steel  lagging, or mats composed of steel bars or heavy steel wire.  Ribs may be installed with appurtenances such as steel tie  rods and collar braces.   When  blocking,  lagging,  and  other  rock  surface  protection materials are installed outside the exterior flange  of  the  rib,  the rib  may  be  included  within  the  final lining  cross-section and relied upon for support.   When  full  or  partial  lagging  is  installed  between  the  flanges of the rib, the rib shall not be relied upon as part of  the final lining cross-section.   Blocking,  lagging,  and  other  rock  surface  protection  materials  are  normally  installed  outside  the exterior flange of the rib for tunnels excavated in  rock by controlled blasting methods, roadheader, or  various types of mechanical excavators.   For TBM tunnels, the circular steel rib section  normally is expanded into full perimeter contact with  the tunnel excavation surface for soft ground, mixed  face, and rock tunnels.    Timber  lagging  generally  is  installed  between  the rib flanges in soft ground and mixed face TBM  tunneling.  Full  perimeter  lagging,  close  lagging  above  springline  and  skeleton  lagging  below  springline, or skeleton lagging around the perimeter  are  used  in  soft  ground  and  mixed  face  tunneling,  depending upon soil conditions.

Otherwise,  timber  lagging  and  deformed  bar/wire  lagging  may  have  to  be  removed  prior  to  placement  of  tunnel  reinforcement  and  concrete.

In rock reinforcement design, the safety factor is  analogous to the LRFD load factor but with a single  load  factor  applied  to  total  load,  and  the  allowable  working  stress  divided  by  the  ultimate  strength  is  analogous  to  the  resistance  factor.  This  article  has  been developed including load factors and resistance  factors  in  this  manner.  For  references  cited  in  this  article,  load  factors  can  substituted  for  factors  of  safety  when  calculating  design  loads  utilizing  procedures contained therein.   9.7.1.1—Pattern Rock Reinforcement   9.7.1.1.1—Selection of Element Length and Spacing   C9.7.1.1.1   Table  9.7.1.1.1-1   is  based  on  precedent   experience.

These recommendations are based on experience with the use of UNWEDGE and UDEC. A comment regarding the  use  of  3DEC  for  more  complex  situations  is  included.  This  appendix  does  not  constitute  the  endorsement  of  any  particular software, nor does it imply that other software that are available or may be introduced in the future is in any  way less reliable than the software described herein.   A9.2—GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SOFTWARE PACKAGES   A9.2.1—Rigid Block Software   Rigid  Block  software  evaluates  support  requirements  for  three-dimensional  (3-D),  rigid  block  wedges.  Wedge  geometry and size are based on the following parameters:   o  Discontinuity dip angle and dip direction.   o  Geometry of the underground opening, azimuth of longitudinal centerline, and grade of opening.   o  Joint strength properties used in the software include:   \\uf02d  Friction  \\uf02d  Cohesion   Wedge size may be determined exclusively by excavation geometry, dip, and dip direction, or can be scaled by using  criteria of apex height and length along the longitudinal axis.   The software also includes the capability to evaluate the effects of horizontal stress ratio, ko, and joint water pressure  on support requirements.   Rigid  Block  software  generally  can  evaluate  the  performance  of  several  types  of  rock  reinforcement  elements  including:   o  Grouted deformed rebar or threadbar (Dywidag bar and similar)  o  Cable bolts  o  Swellex bolts and equivalent  o  Split Set bolts and equivalent  o  Expansion shell rock bolts   Rigid Block software can evaluate the performance of shotcrete based on perimeter shear.    Rigid Block software also generates required confining pressure on the wedge face exposed in the opening perimeter,  which can be used as input for the design of direct rock support (steel ribs).   Dip, dip direction, apex height, and trace length can be varied to assess support requirements based on variations in  wedge geometry.   A9.2.2—Two-Dimensional Distinct Element Method (DEM) Software   Two-dimensional (2-D) DEM software is used to model the behavior of jointed rock masses with or without initial  support. It does not analyze a specific two-dimensional wedge, as does Rigid Block software, but can model in two  dimensions  variations  in  joint  spacing,  apparent  dip  and  persistence.  Thus,  it  is  a  valuable  analytical  tool.  Two- dimensional DEM software can also evaluate deformations of the rock mass and overlying structures, as well as stress   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

This is very helpful when the excavation is at shallow depth below  overlying streets or structures.   Inputs to DEM software include the following:   o  Joint apparent dip and a range of variation for this parameter  o  Joint spacing and a range of variation for this parameter  o  Joint aperture and a range of variation for this parameter  o  Joint persistence and a range of variation for this parameter  o  Joint friction  o  Joint cohesion  o  Joint dilation  o  Joint normal and shear stiffness  o  Stiffness of rock blocks bounded by joints.  o  ko  o  Support element characteristics, similar to UNWEDGE, but adding deformation characteristics   Using the data on dip, dip direction, spacing, and persistence, the software develops a two-dimensional, randomly  generated model representative of possible variation in the field. It then evaluates the behavior of the support system,  the rock mass, and the foundations of overlying structures, including deformations of the rock, overlying foundations,  and support elements and stress distributions within the rock mass and the support elements.   A9.2.3—Three-Dimensional Distinct Element Method (3-D DEM) Software   Use of three-dimensional DEM software may be limited to critical structures or very complex geometries because of  its sophistication and the expertise required for developing the input geometry and subsequent analysis time. However,  with continued software and hardware development, these issues will become less important.   A9.3—RECOMMENDATIONS   A9.3.1—Use of Rigid Block Software   Rigid Block software may be used for the design of rock reinforcement. The Engineer will have to develop parameters  determining wedge size, joint strength properties, and water pressure distribution along the joint surface at various  stages of construction based on project-specific conditions.   During the initial excavation stage, only the support provided by rock reinforcement elements or direct rock support  elements should be considered.   Time  of  application  and  consequent  strength  gain  of  shotcrete  during  sequential  excavation  operations  cannot  be  predicted.  Experience  indicates  that  specification  requirements  or  approved  excavation  and  support  installation  sequences,  particularly  shotcrete  application,  may  be  violated  during  construction,  either  occasionally  or  systematically. Shotcrete should be considered only as an enhancement to short-term factors of safety.   Shotcrete can be considered for evaluation of long-term excavation stability and factors of safety as follows:   \\uf0b7   composite action with rock reinforcement and direct rock support after excavations excavated sequentially  have been opened to their final dimensions    \\uf0b7  water  pressures  on  joint  surfaces  have  been  modified  from  the  initial  excavation  condition  as  a  result  of  groundwater  recovery  due  to  the  presence  of  a  relatively  impermeable  membrane  (shotcrete)  around  the  excavation perimeter.   Selection  of  the  factor  of  safety  for  the  initial  stage,  depending  exclusively  on  the  supporting  capacity  of  rock  reinforcement and direct support, should be selected on the basis of project-specific requirements. As guidance, factors  of safety should be in the range of 1.3 to 1.5. This evaluation can be done outside the LRFD framework.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  All rights reserved.

However, in no case should the initial stage factor of safety be less than 1.3.   Factor of safety for long-term excavation stability, prior to placement of the final lining, should be in the range of 1.5  to 2.0. This evaluation can be done outside the LRFD framework. The factor of safety will be very dependent upon  the  assumptions  used  for  hydrostatic  pressure.  Hydrostatic  pressures  operating  on  joints  will  reduce  the  frictional  component of joint shear strength. This is the reason for the higher range of factor of safety. However, the higher  hydrostatic pressure is appropriate to assume when the 28-day strength of shotcrete is used.    Rigid  Block  software  can  be  used  to  evaluate  support  requirements  related  to  sequential  excavation  of  large  underground openings. An example of this would be the design of initial support for an opening with a nominal width  of 60 ft. Top heading excavation will be accomplished using a central drift and two side slashes with a nominal width  of 20 ft each. Completion of excavation to invert will be by two or more benches.   If excavation is performed by excavating the two side slashes in sequence before excavating the center drift, wedge  size in the crown of the slashes will be determined exclusively by slash geometry, and the wedges in each slash should  be similar, although there may be differences based on dip and dip direction of the various joints. When the center  drift is excavated, a larger wedge, daylighting in one or both of the side slashes may develop. The rock reinforcement  determined in the analysis of the side slashes must be modified to reflect the end-of-excavation stage.    If  the  excavation  is performed by  excavating  the  center  drift first,  followed by  excavating  the  two  side  slashes  in  sequence, a large wedge spanning across the combined width of the center drift and slash may develop. The rock  reinforcement pattern may have to be modified to reflect this situation. Finally, excavation of the second slash may  result in wedges that require further modification of the rock reinforcement pattern.    The rock reinforcement pattern should be designed to support the largest wedge that develops from the analyses.    Both excavation sequences: side slashes, center drift and center drift, side slashes should be evaluated, because the  Contractor could select either approach.   A similar approach should be used in evaluating benching.   The length of the rock reinforcement elements should be checked for constructability. If the reinforcement elements  are to be installed without couplers (and couplers should be avoided for a number of reasons), there must be sufficient  room to install them, bearing in mind the length of the drill and drill boom.   Current hydraulic rock drills have a length of approximately 33–43 in. To allow for the length of the drill, the chuck  which grips the rock reinforcement element, and hydraulic hoses at the top of the drill, use a clear distance from the  drill hole collar to any interfering rock surface not less than the element length plus five ft. If the element length used  in the Rigid Block analysis doesn’t meet this criterion, either adjust drift size, within constraints permitted by geologic  conditions, or reduce element length and spacing between elements to provide an equal factor of safety.   A9.3.2—Use of Two-Dimensional Distinct Element Method (DEM) Software    Two-dimensional DEM software should be used to evaluate the performance of initial support systems designed by  the use of Rigid Block software, using the methodology described above. A minimum of three iterations of variations  of joint patterns should be considered. A greater number of joint pattern variations may be analyzed.   Initially,  the  analysis  for  each  joint  pattern  should  be  run  without  the  presence  of  the  initial  support  to  observe  progressive  raveling/stopping  of  the  rock  blocks  without  support.  This  is  a  useful  aid  for  understanding  the  mechanisms that would develop without the support and to communicate the problem to clients and owners.   For  each  joint  pattern  selected  for  analysis,  the  sequential  excavation  of  the  underground  opening  should  then  be  simulated  using  two-dimensional  distinct  element  analysis,  with  output  after  the  execution  of  each  construction  sequence of:    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Some of the joint patterns randomly generated by two-dimensional DEM software, which indicate instability or failure  of the support system, may have a low probability of occurrence, based on prior experience. Design based on such  unlikely joint patterns is not appropriate.   The project specifications should include provisions for regular geologic mapping of the excavations to indicate if  potentially adverse conditions may be developing. They should also include provisions for installation of additional  support to control any such adverse conditions.

Underground structures, on the other  hand,  behave  differently  than  above  ground  structures  during  earthquakes  due  to  the  surrounding  soil/rock  medium.    The  main  factors  influencing  the  tunnel  seismic  performance can be summarized as: (1) seismic hazard,  (2) geologic  conditions,  and  (3)  tunnel  design, construction,  and  condition.  Seismic  hazard  refers  to ground  shaking  effects  and  ground  failure.  Based  on tunnel  performance  during  earthquakes,  the  damaging effects  of  ground  failure  are  greater  than  the  ground shaking  effects.  Unfavorable  geologic  conditions include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  soft  soils,  shear  zones, transitions from soil to rock, and surrounding geologic units with major contrast in stiffness. These conditions may  result  in  stress  concentrations  in  the  lining  or differential displacements during earthquakes. Elements of  tunnel  design,  construction,  and  condition  (e.g., tunnel  lining  and  support  system,  junctions  of  tunnels with  other  structures,  degree  of  cracking,  and deterioration  of  concrete/steel  materials  for  existing tunnels) may influence tunnel seismic behavior as well.  This Section supplements the seismic provisions of  the  AASHTO  LRFD  Bridge  Design  Specifications  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  LRFD  Specifications)  and  the  AASHTO  Guide  Specification  for  LRFD  Seismic  Bridge  Design  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  Guide  Specifications).  As  such,  this  Section  applies  to  the  seismic  design,  evaluation,  and  rehabilitation  of  highway tunnels. During a seismic event, underground  structures deform as the ground is deformed by seismic  waves.  Underground  structures  shall  be  designed  to  accommodate the seismic deformations imposed by the  ground  (Wang,  1993;  Hashash,  et.  al,  2001;  and  AASHTO 2010).   A  performance  based  evaluation  shall  be  adopted  for  underground  structures,  underground  shaking,  and  ground  failure.  For  analysis  of  performance  of  underground  shaking,  a  pseudo-static  or  dynamic  seismic soil-structure interaction analysis using ground  deformation approach (as opposed to the inertial force  approach) shall be followed as described in this section.  To  evaluate  the  ground  deformations  imposed  by  potential  ground  failures  (e.g.,  liquefaction,  landslide)  and  for  analysis  of  tunnel  performance  underground  failure, provisions included herein as supplemented by  those included in the LRFD Specifications shall be used.  Seismic analysis and design for retaining walls for  retained cut approaches to tunnels shall be performed in  accordance  with  provisions  included  herein  as  supplemented by those included in the latest edition of  the LRFD Specifications.   Seismic  analysis  and  design  for  non-structural  components,  equipment  attachments,  and  support  and  ancillary  structures  (e.g.,  ventilation,  control,  and  administrative  buildings)  in  accordance with local building codes.   shall  be  designed   10.2—DEFINITIONS   For  other  definitions  not  included  herein,  refer  to  the  Guide  Specifications  and  Sections  3  and  10  of  the  LRFD  Specifications.   Compressibility Ratio—A term defining the relative compression stiffness of the ground and a circular structure in the  ground.   Contractor—Entity responsible for the construction of the tunnel and associated construction engineering.   Design—Proportioning and detailing the components and connections of a tunnel.   Ductility—The ability of a material to sustain loads beyond the elastic range. Fiber Reinforced Concrete sustains  loads after cracking and is therefore ductile. Unreinforced concrete rapidly loses strength after the initial crack and is  therefore brittle, rather than ductile.   Embedment Depth Ratio—Ratio of soil cover thickness (from ground surface to top of the underground structure) to  height/diameter of the tunnel.   Engineer—Agency, design firm, or person responsible for the design of the tunnel and/or review of design related  field submittals.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Hence,  multi-level  target  performance  criteria  are  adopted  for  major tunnel projects.    Refer to discussion in Article C10.5.1 for selection  of  design  earthquakes  corresponding  to  the  target  performance levels adopted by these Specifications.   A  two-level  target  performance  criterion  shall  be  adopted  for  seismic  design  and  analysis  of  tunnels  in  consultation with the Owner. The structure shall provide  a  high  level  of  assurance  for  protection  of  life  safety  during and after a Safety Evaluation Earthquake (SEE).  The structure shall also provide a high level of assurance  of continued operation during and after a Functionality  Evaluation  Earthquake  associated  requirements for these performance levels are as follows:   (FEE).  The   SEE:  Such  an  event  has  a  small  probability  of  exceedance during the design service life of the facility.  Following  the  SEE,  some  interruption  in  service  is  permitted.  When  subjected  to  the  SEE,  it  is  acceptable  that the structures behave in an inelastic manner. There  shall be no collapse and no catastrophic inundation with  danger to life. Any structural damage shall be controlled  and  limited  to  the  elements  that  are  repairable.  The  structure  shall  be  designed  with  adequate  strength  and  ductility to survive loads and deformations imposed on  the  structure  during  the  SEE,  thereby  preventing  structural collapse and maintaining life safety.   FEE: Such an event has a lower return period than  the SEE. There shall be minimal interruption in service  during or after the FEE. When subjected to the FEE, the  structure  shall  be  designed  to  respond  in  an  elastic  manner.  There  shall  be  no  collapse,  and  only  minimal  damage to structural elements is permitted. Such damage  shall be minor and repairable. The structure shall remain  fully  operational  immediately  after  the  earthquake,  allowing a few hours for inspection.   For each target performance level described above,  design earthquake return periods shall be established to  evaluate ground motion parameters required for analyses  and  seismic  loads  as  described  in  Article  10.5.1.  If  the  Owner  determines  that  the  tunnel  is  not  a  critical  structure,  single-level  performance  criterion  may  be  target  these  non-critical  structures,  used.  For  performance shall be established by the Owner.   the   10.4.2—Structural Design Check   C10.4.2    Strain  limits  for  the  tunnel  lining  (e.g.,  concrete,  steel reinforcement) shall be established for each design  earthquake  level  to  achieve  the  target  performance  criteria described in Article 10.4.1. The resulting strains  from  the  seismic  demands  combined  with  the  static  demands shall be checked against these strain limits  to  evaluate the structural integrity of the tunnel.   The special components within the tunnel structural  lining (such as gaskets at the segmental lining joints and  the  joint  itself)  shall  be  designed  to  accommodate  stresses  and  deformations  associated  with  the  design   In  lieu  of  better  information,  the  strain  limits  in  Table C10.4.2-1 may be applied for mined/bored tunnel  and cut-and-cover tunnel linings. When selecting strain  limits  for  underground  structures,  factors  such  as  concrete confinement, ease of access, and repairability at  critical locations (e.g., near longitudinal and radial joints  at mined/bored tunnel lining) should be considered.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

For  preliminary  assessment  of  the  ground  shaking  impacts or screening, the empirical procedures presented  in  Article  10.8  or  simplified  numerical  models  may  be  used.  The  underlying  assumptions/limitations  for  these  empirical procedures are discussed in Article C10.8.   10.5—DESIGN   GROUND   MOTION   PARAMETERS   10.5.1—Design Earthquakes   The  return  periods  for  the  SEE  and  FEE  design  earthquakes shall be selected based on the risk acceptable  to  the  Owner  during  the  design  life  of  the  structure.  A  minimum  design  life  of  100  years  shall  be  used  to  evaluate  the  design  earthquake  return  period  unless  otherwise specified by the Owner.   When  selecting  design  earthquakes  for  seismic  design  and  analysis,  the  target  performance  criteria  specified as part of Article 10.4.1 shall be considered.   The  collapse  of  transportation  tunnels  could  have  catastrophic  effects  as  well  as  profound  social  and  economic impacts.    For the SEE level event, infrastructure owners have  used  return  periods  varying  from  1,000  years  to  2,500  years  (majority  2,500  years;  NCHRP  Project  20-68A,  2011)  or  a  combination  of  a  design  earthquake  from  a  probabilistic hazard analysis along with a deterministic  hazard  (e.g.,  California  High  Speed  Train  Project).  A  design  earthquake  with  a  2,500-year  return  period  corresponds  to  4  percent  probability  of  exceedance  in  100 years, approximately.    To avoid lengthy down time and to minimize costly  repairs, a more frequent seismic event is selected for FEE  level analysis. In high seismic areas (e.g., western United  States),  FEE  event  with  a  100-year  return  period  to  approximately  65  percent  of  (corresponding  probability  of  exceedance  in  100  years)  is  generally  defined. In areas where earthquake occurrence is much  less  frequent  (e.g.,  eastern  United  States)  or  when  the  consequence of disruption to the operation of the system  is grave, an earthquake event with a return period greater  than 100 years (up to a 500-year return period or an event  corresponding to 20 percent probability of exceedance in  100 years) is selected for FEE level analysis.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Site-specific seismic hazard analysis, if used, shall  the  LRFD   be  performed  per  Article  3.10.2.2  of  Specifications, except for the following:   (1)  The  earthquake  return  periods  specified  in  Article  10.5.1  of  this  Specification  shall  be  used.   (2)  The  acceleration  response  spectrum  from  the  site-specific  hazard  analysis  shall  be  no  less  than two-thirds of the design response spectrum  developed using the site factors given in Article  3.10.3.2 of the LRFD Specifications.   for   used   seismic   Information   source  characterization  can  often  be  obtained  from  the  publications of the USGS and various state agencies. If  there  is  significant  lag  time  between  development  and  publication,  the  published  hazard  results  may  not  incorporate  recent  developments  on  local  or  regional  seismicity.  There  are  also  other  situations  where  published hazard results may be inadequate and require  site-specific seismic hazard evaluation. These situations  may include: (1) the design earthquake levels (i.e., return  period)  are  different  than  assumed  in  the  published  results, (2) for sites located within six miles of an active  surface  or  shallow  fault  where  near-field  effect  is  considered  important,  and  (3)  the  published  hazard  results fail to incorporate major developments on local or  regional seismicity.   When  using  existing  hazard  analysis  results  published  by  USGS  or  other  credible  agencies,  latest  available  version  of  the  hazard  information  should  be  incorporated, unless  there  is  any  site-specific  reason  to  use the previous versions.   10.5.2.1—Earthquake Magnitude and Distance   C10.5.2.1   Earthquake  magnitude  shall  be  determined  for  the  design earthquakes established for design and analysis. If  probabilistic  seismic  hazard  analysis  is  performed,  the  magnitude  of  from  disaggregation shall be used. In a number of areas in the  U.S.  the  hazard  can  be  dominated  by  more  than  one  source  (e.g.,  Seattle  or  Midcontinent).  The  use  of  conditional  mean  spectra  is  encouraged  to  develop  realistic hazard demand.   the  dominant   earthquakes   Earthquake  magnitude  and  distance  are  required  when  deriving  design  spectra-matching  ground  motion  time  histories  or  when  performing  permanent  ground  deformation  analysis  (e.g.,  liquefaction).  Dominant  earthquake  magnitudes  and  distances, which  contribute  principally to the probabilistic design response spectra at  a site, as determined from national ground motion maps,  can be obtained from disaggregation information on the  USGS website: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/.   10.5.2.2—Peak Ground Motion Parameters   C10.5.2.2   Various   types  of  ground  motion  parameters  including,  but  not  limited  to,  peak  horizontal  ground  acceleration  (PGA)  and  peak  ground  velocity  (PGV),  may be required for seismic analyses, depending on the  analysis method used. PGA shall be established based on  (1) published hazard results by USGS or other credible  agencies;  (2)  attenuation  relationships  if  deterministic  seismic  hazard  evaluation  (3)  disaggregation  analysis  if  site-specific  probabilistic  seismic  hazard  evaluation  is  performed.  PGV  shall  be  evaluated  using  empirical  correlations  with  ground  motion  parameters  or  directly  from  the  velocity  time- histories established for the project.   is  performed;  or   The  Seismic  Analysis  and  Design  of  Retaining  Walls,  Buried  Structures,  Slopes,  and  Embankments  (NCHRP  Report  611,  2008)  provides  a  discussion  on  estimation  of  PGV  based  on  various  ground  motion  parameters.   For preliminary evaluations, values of PGV may be  evaluated using the following correlation between PGV  and design horizontal spectral acceleration at one second  (S1,  in  units  of  g)  as  given  by  Seismic  Analysis  and  Design  of  Retaining  Walls,  Buried  Structures,  Slopes,  and Embankments (NCHRP Report 611, 2008):    PGV (in/sec) = 55 Fv S1         (10.5.2.2-1)   where Fv is the Site Factor for long period range of the  acceleration  spectrum  given  in  Table  3.10.3.2-3  of  the  LRFD Specifications.   Alternatively, PGV can also be evaluated based on   the site-specific seismic response analysis.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

The  wave-passage  effect  may  be  accounted  for  by  assuming  a  time  lag  of  the  ground- motion  time  histories  between  any  two  locations  along  the  tunnel  alignment  (i.e.,  estimated  by  dividing  the  distance  between  the  two  locations  by  the  horizontal  wave travelling velocity along the tunnel alignment).   The horizontal propagation shear wave velocity, CS,  and the pressure wave propagation velocities,  CP, shall  be  established  based  on  consultation  with  experienced  geologists/seismologists.  In  the  absence of site-specific  data,  Cs  and  CP  may  be  assumed  to  be  1.6  miles  per  second  and  3.1  miles  per  second,  respectively  (AASHTO, 2010).   The horizontal propagation shear wave velocity, CS,  in  general, reflects  the  seismic  shear wave propagation  through the deeper rocks rather than that of the shallower  soils where the tunnel is located. In general, this velocity  value  varies  from  about  1.25  to  2.5  miles  per  second;  (O’Rourke  and  Liu,  1999).  The  pressure  wave  propagation  velocities,  CP,  generally  vary  between  2.5  and 5 miles per second.   In  addition  to  wave  passage  effects  and  local  site  conditions,  the  near-field  effects,  incoherence  effects,  and cross-correlation between orthogonal components of  ground  motion  at  different  locations  along  the  tunnel  alignment may also need to be considered.

The shear strain level is also a function of the  ground shaking intensity. As the ground motion intensity  increases,  the  shearing  strain  increases,  resulting  in  reduced equivalent shear modulus.

The combined effects of bending moment and thrust  force on the tunnel lining shall be evaluated as well as the  impact  of  resulting  shear  forces/displacements  on  the  structural integrity of the tunnel.   The general methodology for evaluating the effects  of  TGD  and  PGD  shall  be  in  accordance  with  that  outlined in Articles 10.8.3 and 10.8.4, respectively.   Ground shaking refers to the vibration of the ground  produced by seismic waves propagating through the crust  of  the  earth.  During  ground  shaking,  the  underground  structures undergo three primary modes of deformation:  ovaling/racking,  and  axial  and  curvature  deformations  (Figure C10.8.2-1).

Vertically  propagating  shear  waves  are  generally  considered  the  most critical type of waves for this mode of deformation.

The  racking  effect  on  the  rectangular structure is similar to that of an unbalanced  loading  condition.  For  rigid  frame  box  structures,  the  most critical mode of potential damage due to the racking  effect is the distress at the top and bottom joints.   The  axial  and  curvature  deformations  are  induced  by components of seismic waves that propagate along the  longitudinal  axis  and/or  by  spatially  varying  ground  motions  resulting  from  local  soil/site  effects.  To  accommodate  the  axial  and  curvature  deformations  imposed  by  the  surrounding  ground,  the  lining  will  develop axial and bending strains.   landslides,  lateral   Ground  failure  broadly  includes  various  types  of  ground  instability  such  as  fault  rupture,  tectonic  uplift  liquefaction  (including  and  subsidence,  settlement,  spreading,  liquefaction-induced  floatation, etc.). Each of these PGDs may be potentially  catastrophic to the tunnel although the damage may be  localized.  To  avoid  such  damage,  some  sort  of  ground  improvement  is  generally  required  unless  the  design  approach is to accept displacement, localize the damage  and provide means to facilitate repairs.   10.8.3—Method of Analysis and Assessment—  Ground Shaking Effects   When subject to TGD, the tunnels shall be evaluated  for  at  least  three  primary  modes  of  deformation  that  occur during seismic shaking: ovaling/racking, and axial  and curvature deformations.

Transverse  cross-sections  analyzed for ovaling/racking deformations shall include,  but are not limited to, locations where:   •   •   •   the  free-field  relative  displacements  between  the  top  and  the  bottom  of  the  tunnel  are  large  (significant ovaling/racking deformation);  the  tunnel  is  embedded  partially  in  soil  and  partially in rock, or at an interface between two  strata with a stark contrast in stiffness; and  the structural configuration or framing system is  irregular.

The actual soil-structure system encountered in the  field for underground structures may require the use of  numerical  methods.  The  numerical  modeling  approach  should  be  considered  in  cases  where  the  simplified  methods  are  less  applicable,  more  uncertain  or  inconclusive,  or  where  the  site  is  located  in  a  severe  seismic environment or where case history data indicate  relatively higher seismic vulnerability for similar type of  structures,  or  the  subsurface  profile  consists  of  highly  variable soil/rock conditions.   10.8.3.1.1—Simplified Method for Ovaling Response of   C10.8.3.1.1   Circular Tunnels   Using  the  average  maximum  ground  shear  strain  value  (i.e.,  differential  shear  displacement  between  crown and invert divided by the height of the tunnel) may  lead  to  underestimation  of  the  structure  response,  (i.e.,  especially  Embedment  Ratio,  the  ratio  of  soil  overburden  to  the  height of the tunnel, less than 2.0).    relatively   shallow   tunnels   for   To account for soil–structure interaction effects, two  relative  stiffness  parameters  are  defined  in  AASHTO  (2010).  The  flexibility  ratio  (F)  represents  the  relative  distortion stiffness between the surrounding ground and  the  lining  and  tends  to  govern  the  bending  response  (distortion)  of  the  lining.  The  compressibility  ratio  (C)  the  relative  ring  compression  stiffness  represents  between  the  surrounding  ground  and  the  tunnel  lining  and tends to dominate the thrust/hoop forces in the lining.  When  F<1.0,  the  lining  is  considered  stiffer  than  the  ground,  and  it  tends  to  resist  the  ground  and  therefore  deforms less than that which occurs in the free-field. On  the  other  hand,  when  F>1,  the  lining  is  expected  to  deform more than the free-field. As the flexibility ratio  continues to increase, the lining deflects more and more  than the free-field and may reach an upper limit as the  flexibility ratio becomes infinitely large. This upper limit  deflection  is  equal  to  the  deformations  displayed  by  a  perforated  ground  (i.e.,  an  excavated  conduit  in  the  ground with no lining stiffness).   During  an  earthquake,  in  general,  slip  at  interface  between  the  exterior  wall  of  the  structure  and  the  surrounding soils is a possibility only for tunnels in soft  soils,  or  when  seismic  intensity  is  severe.  For  most  tunnels, the condition at the interface is between full-slip  and no-slip. In computing the forces and deformations in  the lining, it is prudent to investigate both cases and the  more critical one should be used in design and analysis.   When the simplified method is used for evaluation  of ovaling effects on circular tunnels, the analysis shall  be based on the maximum free-field shear strains in the  ground  caused  by  the  governing  vertically  propagating  shear  waves  of  the  design  earthquake  event.  The  free  field  ground  strains  shall  be  estimated  based  on  correlations with peak ground motion parameters (PGV,  PGA)  or  from  site-specific  seismic  site  response  analysis.   The  analysis  shall  take  into  account  the  soil– structure  interaction  effect  to  provide  safe  as  well  as  realistic  design.  The  interface  condition  (i.e.,  full-slip  versus no-slip) at the interface between the exterior wall  of  the  structure  and  the  surrounding  soils  shall  be  conservatively  assumed  to  attain  maximum  structural  response in terms of bending moments and thrust/hoop  forces.    The simplified method for ovaling response of deep  circular tunnels located in a relatively homogenous soil  or rock outlined in the AASHTO Technical Manual For  Design  of  Road  Tunnels—Civil  Elements  (AASHTO,  2010), may be used where appropriate.    For evaluation of maximum free-field shear strains  in the ground, equivalent-linear (e.g., SHAKE; Schnabel  et al., 1972) or non-linear seismic site response analysis  programs may also be used. When a seismic site response  analysis  is  performed,  the  design  maximum  free-field  shear strain shall be based on the maximum shear strain  value computed for the full vertical profile of the tunnel  (i.e., from crown to invert).   10.8.3.1.2—Simplified Method for Racking Response of   Rectangular Tunnels   Racking  deformations  shall  be  defined  as  the  differential  sideways  movement  between  the  top  and  bottom elevations of rectangular tunnel structures, shown  as  ∆s  in  Figure  10.8.3.1.2-1.

Thus, the dynamic subgrade modulus should  be  multiplied  by  the  tributary  area  of  the  soil/rock  represented by an individual spring to estimate the spring  stiffness (i.e., force required for unit deflection).    There are three types of two-dimensional continuum  models that have been used in the engineering practice:  (1)  Pseudo-static Seismic Coefficient Deformation  Method:  The  ground  deformations  are  generated (induced) by seismic coefficients and  distributed in the finite element/finite difference  domain  that  is  being  analyzed.  The  seismic  coefficients can be derived from a separate one- dimensional,  free-field  seismic  site  response  analysis.  The  pseudo-static  seismic  coefficient  deformation method is suitable for underground  structures buried at shallow depths. The general  procedure  in  using  this  method  is  outlined  below:   \\uf0b7  Perform   \\uf0b7  Develop   two-dimensional   free-field  one-dimensional  seismic  site  response  analysis  (e.g.,  using  SHAKE,  DMOD,  or  DEEPSOIL).

The  geologic  medium  (e.g.,  soil)  is  modeled as continuum solid elements and  the  structure  can  be  modeled  either  as  frame  continuum  elements.  The  side  boundary  conditions  should  be  in  such  a  manner  that  all  horizontal  displacements  at  the  side  boundaries  are  free  to  move  and  vertical  displacements  are  prevented  (i.e.,  fixed  boundary condition in the vertical direction  and  the  horizontal direction).

It  should  be  noted  that  this  pseudo-static seismic coefficient approach  is  not  a  dynamic  analysis  and  therefore  does not involve displacement, velocity, or  acceleration  histories.  Instead,  it  imposes  ground shearing displacements throughout  the  entire  soil–structure  system  (i.e.,  the  two-dimensional  continuum  model)  by  applying pseudo-static horizontal shearing  stresses  in  the  ground.  The  pseudo-static  horizontal  shearing  stresses  increase  with  depth and are computed by analysis as the  total  soil  overburden  product  of  pressures  (representing  the  soil  mass)  and  the  horizontal  seismic  coefficients.  The  seismic  coefficients  represent  the  peak  horizontal  acceleration  profile  derived  from  the  one-dimensional  free-field  site  response analysis. The lateral extent of the  domain  in  the  two-dimensional  analysis  system  should  be  sufficiently  far  to  avoid  boundary  effects.  In  this  manner,  the  displacement  profiles  at  the  two  side  boundaries are expected to be very similar  to  that  derived  from  the  one-dimensional  free-field site response analysis. However,  in  tunnel  construction, the displacement distribution  will be different from that of the free field,  reflecting  the  effects  of  soil–structure  interaction  (i.e.,  presence  of  the  tunnel  structure) as well as the effect that portion  of  for  constructing  the  tunnel  (i.e.,  a  void  in  the  ground).   focus  area  near   the  earth  mass   removed   the   the   is   to   the   employed   (2)  Pseudo-dynamic  Time  History  Analysis:  The  procedure  in  pseudo-dynamic  analysis is similar to that for the pseudo-static  seismic coefficient deformation method, except  that the derivation of the ground displacements  and the manner in which the displacements are  imposed  two-dimension  continuum  system  are  different.  The  pseudo-dynamic  analysis consists of stepping the soil–structure  system  statically  through  displacement  time- history  simulations of free-field displacements  obtained  by  a  seismic  site  response  analysis  performed  using  vertically  propagating  shear  waves  (e.g.,  SHAKE,  DMOD,  or  DEEPSOIL  analyses).

In a dynamic time  history analysis, the entire soil–structure system  is subject to dynamic excitations using ground  motion time histories as input at the base of the  soil-structure system.    The  ground  motion  time  histories  used  for  this  purpose  should  be  developed  to  match  the  target  design response spectra and have characteristics that  are representative of the seismic environment of the  site and the site conditions, or they can be developed  from  1-D  seismic  site  response  analysis  (e.g.  SHAKE,  DMOD,  DEEPSOIL)  and  taken  at  the  depth  corresponding  to  the  depth  of  the  soil– structure  interaction  numerical  model.  Special  energy absorbing boundaries should be incorporated  into  the  model  to  allow  radiation  of  the  seismic  energy rather than trapping it.   10.8.3.2—Longitudinal Axial and Curvature   C10.8.3.2   Deformation Effects   When  evaluating  the  longitudinal  response  of  the  tunnel structures, either the simplified analytical method  relatively  more  complex  numerical  modeling  or  approach  shall  be used depending  on  the  degree of  the  complexity  of  the  soil–structure  system,  the  seismic  hazard  level,  and  the  importance  of  the  structures.

If  a  very  stiff  tunnel  is  embedded  in  a  soft  soil  deposit,  significant  soil–structure  interaction  effects  exist, and the free-field deformation procedure may lead  to  an  overly  conservative  design.  In  this  case,  a  simplified  beam-on-elastic-foundation  procedure  shall  be  used  to  account  for  the  soil-structure  interaction  effects as outlined in AASHTO, 2010.

Since  the  inertia  of  a  tunnel  is  small  compared  to  that  of  the  surrounding  geologic  medium,  the analysis is generally performed by using the pseudo- dynamic approach in which free-field displacement time  histories are statically applied to soil springs connected  to  the  model  of  the  tunnel  (to  account  for  the  soil– structure  interaction  effect).  The  general  procedure  for  the  pseudo-dynamic  the  in  longitudinal direction involves the following steps:   time  history  analysis   •  The  free-field  deformations  of  the  ground  at  the  tunnel  elevation  are  first  determined  by  performing  dynamic  site-response  analyses.  For  the  longitudinal  analysis,  the  three-dimensional  effects of ground motions as well as the local site  effect including its spatially varying effect along  the  tunnel  alignment  should  be  considered.

This  assessment shall consider the potential for ground failure  from  uplift/subsidence,  lateral  liquefaction,  seismically-induced  settlement,  spreading, slope instability (landslide), and increases in  lateral earth pressures.   tectonic   rupture,   fault   In  general,  it  is  not  feasible  to  design  a  tunnel  structure  to  withstand  large  ground  displacements.  The  proper  design  measures  in  dealing  with  the  unstable  (1)  ground  ground  conditions  may  consist  of:  stabilization, (2) removal and replacement of the problem  soils, and (3) reroute or deep burial to bypass the problem  zone.    With  regard  to  the  fault  displacements,  the  best  strategy is to avoid any potential crossing of active faults.  If it is not possible, then the general design philosophy is  to accept and accommodate the displacements by either  employing  an  oversized  excavation,  perhaps  backfilled  with  compressible  or  collapsible  material,  or  using  a  ductile lining to minimize the instability potential of the  lining.    If  liquefiable  soil  deposits  or  unstable  soil  masses  that are susceptible to landsliding are identified along the  tunnel  alignment,  more  detailed  evaluations  may  be  required  to  assess  whether  liquefaction  or  landsliding  would be expected to occur during the design earthquake  and to assess the impacts on the tunnel.   10.8.4.1—Liquefaction and Liquefaction-Induced   C10.8.4.1   Ground Deformations   The effects of liquefaction and liquefaction-induced  ground  deformations  shall  be  evaluated  at  relevant  locations  along  the  tunnel  alignment.  These  effects  include:  (1)  uplift,  buoyancy,  and  floatation  of  the  underground structures; (2) large lateral displacements;  and  (3)  post-liquefaction  settlement  and  deformations  (total and differential settlements).   In general, the effects of liquefaction will depend on  the amount of soil that liquefies and the location of the  liquefied  soil  with  respect  to  the  tunnel.  On  sloping  ground, lateral flow, spreading, and slope instability can  occur  on  relatively  thin  layers  of  liquefiable  soils,  whereas the effects of thin liquefied layers at sites with  level ground surface may be insignificant.   If  liquefaction  is  estimated  to  occur  adjacent  to  a  tunnel  lining  or  wall,  a  potential  consequence  can  be  yielding of the lining or wall due to the increased lateral  earth  pressures  in  the  liquefied  zone.  The  pressure  exerted  by  a  liquefied  soil  may  be  as  large as  the  total  overburden pressure.   10.8.4.1.1—Evaluation of Liquefaction Potential   C10.8.4.1.1   An initial screening study followed by more refined  analyses  and  evaluation  of  the  impact  on  the  tunnel  structure shall be conducted. A site-specific seismic site  response  analysis  or  the  empirical  procedures,  as  applicable, shall be used for liquefaction evaluation.   For  soil  layers  deeper  than  65  ft  below  ground  surface, only site-specific seismic site response analyses  shall be performed to estimate earthquake-induced shear  stresses.   If  earthquake-induced  shear  stresses  are  evaluated  using  the  empirical  procedures,  the  site-adjusted  peak  ground  acceleration (PGA)  should be used (see Article  10.5.2).   The  empirical  liquefaction  evaluation  procedures  discussed herein are generally applicable for liquefaction  analysis up to the depth of about 65 to 80 ft below the  ground surface or mud line.   For fine-grained soils up to the depth of 65 ft below  the ground surface or mud line, the evaluation criteria for  liquefaction  (or  for  significant  strength  reduction  potential) may be in accordance with those discussed in  Youd  et  al.  (2001)  and  Idriss  and  Boulanger  (2008).  Appropriate laboratory shear strength testing data (e.g.,  tri-axial cyclic shear strength tests) can also be used to  supplement this evaluation.

If  the  potentially  liquefiable  layers are present only above the tunnel crown level at  relatively  more  shallow  depths,  any  strength  loss  or  permanent  ground  deformations  (e.g.  flow  failure)  will  not impact the integrity of the tunnel structure.   10.8.4.2—Seismic Slope Instability and Landslides   C10.8.4.2   The potential for seismically induced landslides and  slope  instability  shall  be  evaluated  along  the  tunnel  alignment. If quasi-static slope stability analysis is used,  the capacity-to-demand ratio shall not be less than 1.0 for  the FEE and SEE.

The  impact of the potential slope movements on the affected  structures  shall  be  assessed.  If  the  impact  assessments  yield  unacceptable  performance  of  the  structures,  appropriate mitigation measures shall be incorporated.   slope  movements,  using   A  capacity-to-demand  ratio  of  1.0  for  the  seismic  slope  stability  analysis  is  used  as  a  screening  step  for  evaluating  the  need  for  a  more  rigorous  seismic  displacement analysis. A capacity-to-demand ratio of 1.0  or greater from a seismic slope stability analysis typically  indicates  acceptable  seismic  displacements.  However,  further  evaluation  of  seismic  displacements  and  the  resulting impact on the tunnel structure is warranted if a  capacity-to-demand ratio less than 1.0 is obtained from  seismic slope stability analysis.   When  quasi-static  seismic  stability  analysis  is  performed  for  permanent  structures,  the  horizontal  seismic coefficient should not be less than 50 percent of  the  peak  ground  acceleration,  PGA  (expressed  as  a  percent of the gravitational acceleration constant), at the  site location of interest.

A  detailed discussion of seismic slope stability evaluation  methods  is  given  in  Seismic  Analysis  and  Design  of  Retaining  Walls,  Buried  Structures,  Slopes,  and  Embankments (NCHRP Report 611, 2008).   10.8.4.3—Active Fault Crossing Displacement Effects   C10.8.4.3   The evaluation of the effects of active fault crossing  displacements  on  the  integrity  of  the  tunnel  includes  characterization  of  the  free-field  displacement  (i.e.,  displacement in the absence of the tunnel) where the fault  crosses  the  tunnel  and  assessment  of  the  effects  of  the  characterized displacements on the tunnel. The analysis  shall be performed using analytical procedures.   A detailed discussion of evaluation of the effects of  active fault crossing displacements is given in AASHTO  Technical  Manual  for  Design  of  Road  Tunnels—Civil  Elements  (AASHTO,  2010),  including  the  analytical  models for assessment of the seismic demands associated  with  fault  rupture.  For  a  discussion  of  estimating  fault  rupture  displacement  demands,  refer  to  LRFD  Seismic  Analysis  and  Design  of  Transportation  Geotechnical  Features and Structural Foundations (FHWA, 2011).   10.9—SEISMIC DESIGN OF TEMPORARY   C10.9   STRUCTURES   Depending  on  the  regional  seismicity,  duration  of  target  temporary  conditions,  and  established  the  performance criteria, design seismic loads equivalent to  50 to 100 percent of FEE levels have been used for the  temporary structures by various infrastructure owners.    regional   seismicity,  duration  of   Temporary  structures,  such  as  excavation  support  systems and the underground structures under temporary  conditions, shall be designed to resist seismic loads. The  design earthquake for the temporary structures shall be  established  in consultation  with  the Owner considering  temporary  the  conditions,  and  the  target  performance  levels  for  these  structures.  As  a  minimum  requirement,  the  tunnel  structures  shall  be  designed  to  avoid  collapse  and  any  damage  shall  be  repairable.  In  any  case,  the  design  seismic  loads  for  the  temporary  structures  shall  not  be  less than 50 percent of the FEE ground motion intensity.   In  locations  where  adjacent  buildings  and  their  foundations  create  an  in  conjunction  with  temporary  ground  support  structures  that  would  significantly  influence  the  seismic  response  of  the  adjacent  buildings  themselves,  the  combined  group  of  temporary  ground  support  and  building  structural  configurations  shall  also  be  analyzed  as  a  single permanent structure.   interaction  configuration   10.10—RETAINING STRUCTURES AND   C10.10   PORTALS   The seismic impact on the retaining structures and  portals  shall  be  considered.  In  general,  the  seismic  impacts  may  be  evaluated  using  seismic  slope  stability  analysis  (Article  10.8.4.2)  or  using  dynamic  earth  pressures (such as using the Mononabe-Okabe method to  derive  the  dynamic  earth  pressures  for  evaluation  of  sliding and overturning potential of the portal structures,  as discussed in the LRFD Specifications), depending on  the configuration of the retaining structures and portals.   For  calculation  of  seismic  earth  pressures  and  limitations associated with different methods of analyses,  see Article 11.6.5 of the LRFD Specifications.    For  seismic  analysis  and  design  for  retaining  structures  and  portals,  a  performance  based  design  approach  should  be  adopted.  Refer  to  Seismic  Analysis  and  Design  of  Retaining  Walls,  Buried  Structures,  Slopes,  and  Embankments  (NCHRP  Report  611,  2008)  for deformation based approaches applicable to seismic  design of these structures.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

If  the  results  of  the  longitudinal  tunnel  response  analysis  indicate  that  seismic  demands  are  above  the  limits  for  the  tunnel  structure,  seismic  joints  or  other  alternatives  shall  be  incorporated  to reduce  the  seismic  demands. If seismic joints are found to be necessary, the  seismic displacement demands for the seismic joint shall  be evaluated based on 3-D numerical models capable of  modeling the longitudinal response of the tunnel together  with seismic joints.    10.13—NON-STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS AND   EQUIPMENT   Permanent  nonstructural  components  (including  architectural  components),  their  attachments  and  the  (including  for  permanent  equipment  attachments  mechanical/electrical systems) supported by a structure  shall  be  designed  in  accordance  with  the  International  Building  Code  (IBC).

These  interfaces  often  involve  large  open  excavations.  The  impact  of  the  large  open  excavations  required  for  tunnel  construction  must  be  considered  during the environmental planning phase of the project.   During dredging for immersed tunnels, consideration  shall be given to investigating certain excavation methods  for  the  possibility  of  limiting  suspended  solids,  such  as  the  use  of  sealed  buckets.  During  the  National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) phase, existing fauna  and flora and other ecological issues shall be investigated  to  determine  whether  environmentally  and  ecologically  adverse  consequences  are  likely  for  a  specific  project.  Also, an assessment on fish migration, spawning periods,  and mitigation measures shall be identified.   As  the  project  advances  into  final  design,  ensure  compliance with the approved NEPA document, continue  to  evaluate  and  assess  environmental  impacts  for  consistency with the NEPA document, continue to avoid  and minimize impacts as much as possible during design,  implement  environmental  commitments  and  mitigations   Depending on the tunnel alignment, road tunnels can  in many ways lessen environmental impacts as compared  to surface roadways and bridges. Tunneling can help to  reduce  traffic  congestion,  improve  regional  air  quality,  reduce  noise,  and  improve  aesthetics.  Tunnels  also  provide  opportunities  for  improved  economic  potential  from  land development  opportunities  at  the  surface.  On  the other hand, immersed tunnels have impacts related to  underwater bed levels and dredging activities. Dredging  generates bottom disturbance and creates turbidity in the  water.   Environmental  effects  that  are  typically  evaluated  during NEPA/planning and into the design phase include:  ecological  (such  as  the  effects  on  natural  resources and on the components, structures,  and functioning of affected ecosystems),   •   •  water quality,   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Permits  and  approvals  are  typically  obtained  as  the  project  design  and  limits  of  disturbance  are  further  refined.  This  includes  implementing  avoidance  and  minimization design measures and finalizing construction  staging and access areas.

A.3.5—Wetlands/Waterways   CA.3.5   Waters of the U.S., including wetlands, are regulated  under  Sections  401  and  404  of  the  Clean  Water  Act.  Executive Order 11990 of the Federal Register (FR) (42  FR 26961E.O. 11990, May 1977), entitled Protection of  Wetlands, was enacted to avoid to the extent possible the  long- and short-term adverse impacts associated with the  destruction or modification of wetlands, to avoid direct or  indirect  support  of  new  construction  in  wetlands  wherever there is a practicable alternative, and to ensure  that  proposed  construction  incorporates  all  possible  measures  to  limit  harm  to  wetlands.  Many  states  also  regulate these resources.   Impacts to wetlands/waterways will vary depending on  a specific project and may include impacts at the surface,  near portals or portal approaches, or impacts may occur  from dredging operations associated with the construction  of immersed tunnels.   Immersed tunnels are often selected over bridges for  water crossings for various reasons such as shorter portal  approaches  and  shorter  overall  length  as  compared  to  bridges. Tunnels can also be used to avoid the potential  hazards  to  navigation  that  can  be  created  by  bridges.  Tunnels can also often be constructed in soils that would  otherwise create challenges to a bridge structure. Despite  some  of  these  advantages,  trench  excavation  in  any  issue.  waterway  Immersed tunnels often have negative impacts related to  underwater bed levels and dredging activities. Dredging  generates bottom disturbance and creates turbidity in the  water, which can affect aquatic ecology, fish or aquatic  species habitat, fish migration, and spawning periods.   is  an  environmentally  sensitive   Trench   excavation   complicated  by  contaminated  materials,  tides,  storms,  and  construction  restrictions in waterways due to environmental concerns.   is  often   During  the  design  phase,  wetlands  and  waterways  shall  be  delineated  and  flagged  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  Wetland  Delineation Manual or appropriate regional supplement.  If  these  resources  were  previously  delineated  during  an  earlier phase (e.g., NEPA or planning phase), verify with  the regulatory agencies that the delineation remains valid  and that all resources remain jurisdictional. The extent of  the  field  delineation  shall  also  be  evaluated  to  confirm  that  the  wetlands/waterways  delineation  study  area  encompassed  the  entire  limit  of  disturbance  established  during  the  design  phase.  If  not,  a  supplemental  field  delineation may be required.   Installation  of  an  immersed  tunnel  requires  agency  coordination  and  procurement  of  a  Section  404  permit  and other related disposal site permits.   Once the environmental conditions have been set by  the  planning  and  permitting  process,  extreme  care  shall  be  taken  to  meet  these  permit  conditions,  including  incorporation of design elements and clear specifications  to the Contractor.    During design, scheduling of construction activities,  use of  environmentally  friendly  construction  techniques  and equipment, and innovative methods of dealing with  contaminants shall be considered.   Wetland/waterway avoidance or minimization design  strategies  committed  to  during  earlier  phases  shall  be  adhered  to,  and  any  additional  design  techniques  for  further  avoidance/minimization  shall  be  considered  and  implemented where practicable and to the greatest extent  practicable.  For  example,  for  an  immersed  tunnel,  dredging  methods  and  equipment  shall  be  designed  to  limit the dispersal of fine materials in the water. Turbidity  or  silt  curtains  or  other  measures  shall  be  used  where  appropriate. Methods, materials, and mitigation measures  shall  be  specified  to  avoid  or  reduce  the  impacts  of  excavation,  filling,  and  other  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Similar  state  and  local  permits  may  also  be  required.  Measures  shall  also be taken to mitigate these impacts in accordance with  Section 404 and Section 10.   Mitigation  measures  employed  to  compensate  for  unavoidable  project  effects  to  waters  of  the  U.S.,  including  wetlands,  shall  follow  federal  and  state  regulations  as  other  recommendations  from  federal  and  state  resource  agencies.   and  guidelines,   as  well   A.3.6—Navigable Waterways   CA.3.6   Navigable waters within the project study area shall  be identified, and a Section 10 permit shall be obtained, if  applicable.   The  USACE  regulates  structures  that  are  located  in,  under, or over navigable waters of the U.S. under Section  10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.   Navigable waters of the U.S. are those “waters that are  subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and/or are presently  used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible  for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce” (33  C.F.R  Part  329.4).  Coordination  with  the  USACE  and  U.S.  Coast  Guard  is  recommended  to  determine  the  navigability of certain waterways.   Projects requiring a Section 10 permit may range from  a simple tunnel bore crossing of a small stream considered  to  be  navigable  to  an  immersed  tunnel  project  within  a  large waterway or harbor.    All impacts on navigation in all navigable waterways  shall  be  considered  and  addressed,  and  often  require  extensive permitting.   A.3.7—Groundwater   During design, groundwater levels shall be evaluated  to  determine  the  need  and  extent  for  dewatering  operations. When groundwater levels are higher than the  base level of the tunnel, excavations require dewatering.  Dewatering systems vary depending on soil permeability.  Precautions shall be taken on dewatering to avoid impacts  such as lowering the water table outside the excavation,  which could cause settlement of adjacent structures, loss  of  soil,  impact  on  vegetation,  drying  of  existing  water  supply  wells,  and  potential  movement  of  contaminated  plumes,  if  present.  Consider  the  use  of  impermeable  excavation  support  walls  that  extend  down  to  a  firm,  reasonably impermeable stratum, which will reduce or cut  off  water  flow.  Other  design  techniques  may  include  impervious  retaining  walls,  such  as  steel  interlocking  sheeting,  secant  pile  walls, or  concrete  slurry  walls,  for  use in deeper less pervious layers to reduce groundwater  inflow  during  construction  and  limit  draw-down  of  the  existing groundwater table.

Necessary dewatering permits shall be obtained, and  dewatering  must  be  performed  according  to  permit  specifications/requirements.   A.3.8—Cultural Resources    CA.3.8   Historic  and  archaeological  resources  shall  be  assessed in accordance with the regulations (36 CFR Part  800) implementing Section 106 of the National Historic  Preservation Act of 1966, and the area of potential effects  (APE)  for  the  project  shall  be  determined  by  the  lead  federal  agency  in  consultation  with  the  State  Historic  (SHPO).  Be  aware  of  any  Preservation  Office  Programmatic  Agreements  (PAs)  or  Memorandums  of  Agreement  (MOAs)  executed  during  planning,  and  adhere to the commitments at the appropriate times during  design and construction.   During  the  design  phase,  cultural  resources  shall  continue  to  be  evaluated  to  ensure  that  the  design  complies  with  the  original  Section  106  assessment  of  effects. Additionally,  if  a  Section 106  PA or  MOA  was  executed  for  the  project,  the  Engineers  shall  review  the  PA or MOA for stipulations related to cultural resource  processes  for  the  completion  of  the  project  and  for  mitigation requirements in accordance with Section 106,  as applicable.   Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic  Preservation Act of 1966 is typically initiated during the  NEPA  process;  however,  impacts  to  cultural  resources  must continue to be evaluated during the design phase to  ensure  continued  compliance.  PAs  or  MOAs  are  also  typically  executed  during  the  NEPA  planning  phase;  however,  they  are  typically  implemented  during  the  design and construction phases. Continued coordination  with  the  SHPO  and  continued  assessment  is  typically  required  as  the  project  advances  into  the  design  and  construction phases.   During the design phase, it is typical that a Phase IB  archeology identification survey of limits of disturbance  of the subsurface alignment be conducted, along with any  additional  Phase  II  archeological  evaluation  studies  of  archeological sites identified, and Phase III archeological  data recovery efforts for National Register-eligible sites  that  cannot  be  avoided.  The  Section  106  PA  or  MOA  typically outlines these work efforts.   The  design  team  and  lead  agency  shall  continue  consultation  during  design  with  the  SHPO,  with  input  from  other  consulting  parties,  for  identifying  additional  potential  historic  properties,  identifying  and  minimizing  and/or  mitigating  unanticipated  adverse  effects,  and  providing  project  plans  and  soliciting  comments  on  design-related issues of the built project components.  to  commitments  related   to  continued   Adhere   coordination with Section 106 Consulting Parties.    Typically, the PA or MOA will stipulate requirements  for  continued  coordination  efforts  during  design  with  references to type of coordination necessary and at what  design milestones.   A.3.9—Environmental Justice   CA.3.9   Compliance with Executive Order 12898 is typically   completed during the NEPA process.   through   Federal projects shall comply with Executive Order  12898,  “Federal  Actions  to  Address  Environmental  in  Minority  Populations  and  Low-Income  Justice  Populations,”  as  the  U.S.  implemented  Department  of  Transportation  Order  (U.S.  DOT  Order)  5610.2(a) to Address Environmental Justice in Minority  Populations.  Populations  Disproportionate  to  Environmental  Justice  populations  must  continue  to  be  evaluated  during  the  design phase to ensure continued compliance, which may  include  continued  public  outreach  to  Environmental  Justice  communities.

Engineers  shall  request  a  copy  of  the   Public  and  agency  involvement  is  integral  to  the  overall project efforts throughout the planning and design  phases  of  projects.  Public  involvement  early  during  the  planning  and  NEPA  phase  allows  for  consideration  of  public comment related to the range of alternatives, the  tunnel  alignment/location,  and  other  concerns  such  as  environmental impacts.   Section  1506.6  of  NEPA  requires  the  lead  federal  agency  to  involve  the  public  throughout  the  NEPA  process. The lead agency for federal highway projects is  typically FHWA. Specifically, the FHWA policy 23 CFR  Section  771.105(c)  states,  “Public  involvement  and  a  systematic  interdisciplinary  approach  are  essential  parts  of  the  development  process  for  proposed  actions.”  The  lead agency has the responsibility to ensure compliance  with  NEPA  and  prepare  the  environmental  document.  The  lead  agency  is  also  responsible  (during  NEPA)  for  identifying  and  inviting  cooperating  and  participating  agencies.  Cooperating  agencies,  as  defined  in  23  CFR  Section  771.109(3),  are  federal  agencies  that  are  requested to participate during the NEPA phase because  they  have  jurisdiction  by  law  or  special  expertise.  Cooperating  agencies  may  also  include  state  or  local  agencies and tribal governments. There may be multiple  cooperating agencies depending on the issues associated  with  the  project.  Participating  agencies  may  include  federal,  state,  Native  American  local  tribal,  and  government entities with an interest in the project.   Effective  public  and  agency  involvement  typically  assists in a meaningful and productive process that results  in  minimal  project  delays.  It  is  important  to  learn  the  viewpoints and opinions of stakeholders in transportation  projects as it is the stakeholders that tend to be the users  or those affected by the construction or traffic related to  projects.   Refer to the NEPA decision document for information  on  cooperating  and  participating  agencies,  and  for  any  specific  public  and  agency  involvement  commitments  that  require  implementation  during  later  phases  of  the  project, including the design phase.    © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

For  some  projects,  a  public/agency  involvement  plan  is  prepared that outlines the plan to engage the public and  agencies throughout the life of the project, from planning,  through design and construction.   public/agency   commitments   and   A.3.13—Economics   CA.3.13   During  the  NEPA  phase,  the  characteristics  of  the  existing  economy  within  the  project  study  corridor  and  the likely effects associated with the project’s preferred  alternative  on  the  economy  are  considered  and  documented. In addition to general economic impacts, the  NEPA document typically also discusses the fiscal impact  of the project on local property taxes. An analysis of tax  revenue  changes  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  project  is  typically  conducted  and  documented  in  the  NEPA  document. For example, the analysis would be based on  right-of-way  needs  associated  with  the  estimated  construction of the preferred alternative.   During  the  design  phase,  adhere  to  the  final  NEPA  decision document. Any proposed substantive changes to  the preferred alternative shall be evaluated in accordance  with 23 CFR Sections 771.129 and 771.130 and shall be  approved  by  the  lead  federal  agency  before  the  agency  may  proceed  with  the  change.  If  a  reevaluation  or  supplemental document is required, the economics shall  also be reassessed. As the project moves into final design,  construction duration and budget projections, as well as  right-of-way  requirements,  shall  continue  to  be  refined  and evaluated. Any newly acquired private property shall  be transferred to transportation use and become part of the  public right-of-way, thus removing the property from the  local tax base.

During design, the effects of trends  in labor and material cost fluctuations shall be projected  to the future tunnel construction year. The cost of future  expenditures during the projected service life of the tunnel  shall be considered. Regional factors, such as availability  of skilled labor, material, fabrication, location, shipping,  and erection constraints, shall also be considered.   the  design  phase,   During  the  design  phase,  the  option  for  accepting  alternative  contract  plans  may  be  considered  and  bid  competitively.  If  this  option  is  selected,  the  alternative  plan  designs  shall  be  equally  safe,  serviceable,  and  aesthetically pleasing.

It is ideal to be able to tunnel with the  full face in a single ground condition for the entire length  of the tunnel, but this is rarely the case.   During  the  NEPA  process,  impacts  to  any  existing  infrastructure shall be considered and assessed based on  the preliminary tunnel design. The choice for location and  profile of the tunnel shall have already been supported by  analyses  of  alternatives,  which  is  typically  completed  during the planning and NEPA phase of tunnel projects.   During design, review the NEPA document related to  anticipated impacts to existing infrastructure, as well as  any  design-related  commitments  or  other  mitigation  measures.  As  the  design  phase  advances  beyond  the  NEPA  phase,  attention  shall  continue  to  be  directed  toward  providing  for  favorable  tunnel  design  that  minimizes adverse impacts to other existing infrastructure  while  maintaining  safety.

Even if a permit is not required,  there  are  typically  requirements  or  commitments  to  coordinate  infrastructure  impacts  during  the  design  and  construction  permit  phases.  Coordination  procurements shall be completed at the appropriate times  during  design,  construction,  and  post  construction,  including operation and maintenance activities.   and   Some  permit  requirements  extend  beyond  the  construction  phase  of  a  project.

A.6—CONSTRUCTABILITY CONSIDERATIONS   CA.6   The design phase of tunnel projects shall identify and  design  based  on  anticipated  construction  methods,  activities, and sequencing that are reasonably expected to  be  employed  and  undertaken  during  the  construction  phase.  The  NEPA  document  includes  commitments or mitigation measures to be considered or  implemented  during  the  design  and  construction  phases  to  mitigate  or minimize  negative  environmental  effects.  During  design,  these  commitments  or  mitigation  measures that were previously agreed to shall be reviewed  and implemented, as applicable.   typically   to   The  vertical  profile  of  the  tunnel  shall  be  set  with  the  geologic  conditions  and  existing  respect  underground  the  surface  infrastructure  as  well  as  infrastructure  above  the  tunnel.  Ground  subsidence  and  vibrations  during  construction  shall  be  monitored  and  controlled.  Staging  areas  shall  be  identified  and  made  secure.  Construction  noise  shall  be  managed  and  muck  removed and disposed of. During design, the design team  shall  consider  construction  means  and  methods  for  avoiding  and  minimizing  impacts  from  construction  activities. For example, consideration of using a barge in  certain  areas  for  the  storage  and  transport  of  material,  rather  than  creating  excessive  traffic  along  haul  routes.  Proper  planning  and  restrictions  on  activities  shall  be  performed  in  order  to  meet  local  ordinances  and  accommodate existing adjacent land use.   environmental   During  design,  construction  specifications  shall  be  developed such that construction contractors comply with  and  obtain  applicable  necessary  permits  for  the  duration  of  construction.  Construction of a project shall follow applicable federal,  state,  and  local  laws  for  building  and  safety,  as  well  as  local noise ordinances, as applicable.   regulations    A  fabrication  location  site  shall  be  identified  for  immersed  tunnels,  as  required.  Dredging  methods  and  equipment shall be designed to limit the dispersal of fine  materials in the water. Turbidity or silt curtains or other  measures  shall  be  used  where  appropriate.  Methods,  materials, and mitigation measures shall be used to avoid  or  reduce  the  impacts  of  excavation,  filling,  and  other  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment.  The  Engineer  shall  identify  an  acceptable  and  approved  containment  disposal  site  for  the  muck  removed  from  the  excavated  trench for construction of an immersed tunnel.   Though  the  location  and  type  (i.e.,  bore,  immersed,  cut-and-cover)  of  tunnels  are  typically  identified  in  the  planning  and  NEPA  phase,  construction  details  are  not  finalized during these early phases, and therefore require  much greater attention to detail during the design phase.  For  the  majority  of  their  length  and  depending  on  the  construction  method,  tunnels  have  no  impact  on  the  surface.  Cut-and-cover  construction  would  be  very  disruptive at the surface during construction, while tunnel  boring is only disruptive at the surface portal locations.    construction   The  areas  that  are  typically  most  affected  by  construction  activities  generally  comprise  the  areas  activity.  the  immediately  bordering  However,  in  some  cases,  effects  from  construction  activities extend beyond the immediate area surrounding  construction  sites.  For  example,  the  traffic  effects  of  delivering  or  transporting  material  off  site  include  a  bigger study area than the study area for the noise effects  of constructing a tunnel portal.   Construction  of  an  immersed  tunnel  consists  of  excavating  an  open  trench  in  the  bed  of  a  water  body.  Tunnel elements are fabricated off site, transported to the  tunnel  location,  lowered  into  the  excavated  trench,  connected together, and backfilled.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Specific  environmental  requirements  and  controls  shall  be  tailored  to  the  construction  contract(s)  and  included  in  contractor  specifications.   Prior  to  construction,  and  often  during  the  design  phase, construction environmental protection plans, or a  similar type of plan, are prepared. The purpose of these  plans  is  to  identify  means,  methods,  and  coordination  necessary to limit potential impacts to the environment,  protected resources, and communities within and adjacent  to a project. These reports typically identify:    •  Project  specific  environmental  requirements  required to comply with federal, state, and local  regulatory permit conditions and the procedures  defined to meet them.   •  Define   environmental   and  mitigation measures stipulated within the NEPA  document to ensure that these requirements are  identified in the contract documents.   commitments   •  Define  responsibilities  and  actions  required  to  maintain  environmental  compliance  with  requirements  during  design  and  construction,  and to effectively respond to problem situations  or agency/public concerns.   •  Establish   necessary   for  communication,  documentation,  and  review  of  environmental  compliance  activities  for  the  construction contract.   procedures   •  Describe protected resources within the project  area and the types of mitigation measures needed  to protect them.   •  Ensure  that  Contractors  submit  all  documents  required  in  the  contract  documents  as  they  pertain to the Contractor’s work, and ensure that  Contractors  provide  all  means  and  methods  to  avoid  or  minimize  impacts  to  the  environment  and  general  public  in  compliance  with  the  construction contract documents.   A.6.1—Construction Methodology   CA.6.1   A  number  of  construction  methods  may  be  used  to  build tunnels depending on geological and environmental  conditions,  cost,  schedule,  alignment,  tunnel  size  and  length, and other factors. Specific construction methods  and  activities  may  be  refined  during  design  and  as  the  construction  delivery  methods  are  identified  (Design- build, Design-bid-build, or other delivery methods).   Typical tunneling construction methods that shall be  considered and evaluated during design and depending on  specific  project  circumstances  (i.e.,  under  land,  under  water) include cut-and-cover excavation, bored or mined  tunnels, or immersed tunnels. Depending on project site  conditions, construction methods shall be evaluated and  determined, and may include drilling and blasting, tunnel  boring machines (TBMs), sequential excavation method,  or  jacked  tunnel  methods,  among  others.  Different  methods may work for different construction activities— whether  it  is  the  actual  tunnel  portion  or  an  associated  tunnel portal.    Additional information regarding tunnel construction  methodology  can  be  found  in  AASHTO’s  Technical  Manual for Design and Construction of Road Tunnels— Civil Elements.   The selected construction method will have an effect  on  the  types  of  environmental  impacts  expected  during  construction.   The types of equipment typically used for construction  include  various  earth-moving  machines  (excavators,  graders,  bulldozers,  loaders,  etc.),  cranes,  pile  drivers,  augers,  drills,  compaction  rollers  and  tampers,  concrete  trucks,  pumping  equipment,  generators/compressors,  various types of trucks (flat bed, dumps, trailers, etc.), and  mechanical  excavating  equipment  such  as  TBMs  and  roadheaders.

This   contract   The  design  team  shall  also  consider  the  need  for  development  of  a  Noise  and  Vibration  Control  Plan,  which is typically comprised of a Noise Monitoring Plan,  a  Noise  Abatement  Plan,  a  Vibration  Monitoring  Plan,  and a Vibration Abatement Plan. During the design phase,  the need for and the responsible party for preparing these  plans shall be determined, and these documents shall be  prepared prior to construction.    During   the  planning,  NEPA  and  preliminary  engineering  phase  of  major  tunnel  projects,  a  noise  assessment  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  NEPA,  23  CFR 772, Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic  Noise and Construction Noise, as amended July 13, 2010,  and other relevant federal and state guidance.   Road tunnel vibration concerns are typically related  to construction operations, such as drilling and blasting,  and not long-term operation effects. There are no federal  requirements  directed  specifically  to  highway  traffic  induced vibration. All studies that highway agencies have  done  to  assess  the  impact  of  traffic-induced  vibrations  have shown  that  both  measured  and predicted  vibration  levels  are  less  than  any  known  criteria  for  structural  damage  to  buildings  (FHWA,  Highway  Traffic  Noise:  Analysis  and  Abatement  Guidance,  Appendix  G,  December 2011).    The location of noise and vibration monitoring sites  is  long-term  identified  and  preliminary  predicted  operational  and  short-term  construction  effects  are  assessed  and  documented  in  the  NEPA  document  and  detailed  technical  reports.  Mitigation  measures  are  typically investigated to determine their effectiveness in  reducing  or  eliminating  noise  effects.  The  NEPA  document  will  include  some  recommended  measures  to  mitigate  or  reduce  any  potential  noise  and  vibration  effects;  however,  approved  control  measures  are  considered  and  incorporated  into  the  project  during  final design.   likely   The  Noise  and  Vibration  Control  Plan  is  typically  implemented prior to construction to avoid and minimize  noise and vibration impacts. It is not uncommon that the  contract specifications require the Contractor to develop  this plan.   A.6.2.1—Noise Controls   CA.6.2.1   A  Noise  Monitoring  Plan  and  a  Noise  Abatement  Plan,  when  required,  shall  identify  and  implement  mitigation  measures  to  control  noise  levels  during  construction.

While  this  article  does  not  address  hazardous  contaminant,  during  the  design  phase,  proper  investigations and studies shall be conducted to identify  the  potential  for  hazardous  contaminants  within  the  the  contract  construction  zone.  At  a  minimum,  specifications  shall  outline  for  providing relevant environmental compliance documents  and managing contaminated materials.   responsibility   the   A.6.4—Staging Areas   CA.6.4   Identify and set up staging areas where construction  machinery and other equipment and materials would be  delivered,  stored,  and  operated.  Staging  areas  may  also  accommodate  assembly,  launching,  and  removal  of  TBMs,  means  and  methods  for  ventilating  the  tunnel,  storage  of  excavated  soil  and  rock,  electrical  service  equipment or substation and maintenance, truck loading  and  unloading,  and  rebar  cage  assembly,  among  other  uses.   Construction  staging  areas  shall  be  considered  and  identified  during  the  design  phase,  if  not  earlier.  Their  locations  shall  be  selected  based  on  a  variety  of  considerations and factors, including but not limited to:   •  •  •   size,   proximity to construction work areas,   existing and surrounding land uses, and    typically   Tunnel  project  construction   requires  disturbance  on  above-ground  sites  for  the  temporary  stockpiling  of  spoils  (muck)  from  the  tunnels  and  for  construction materials,  machinery, and workers to enter  and  exit  the  areas  being  excavated.  Depending  on  available land uses within a particular project study, very  few  vacant  parcels  are  often  available  within  close  proximity to the proposed alignment that could be used  for staging areas, particularly in urban environments.   Construction  staging  areas,  also  referred  to  as  “laydown areas,” are sites that are used for the storage of  materials  and  equipment  and  other  construction-related  activities.    Immersed tunnel construction requires large staging  areas  for  the  fabrication  of  the  tunnel  elements.  These  staging areas must have water access in order to launch  the elements for transportation to the tunnel site.   © 2017 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

During design, these staging areas shall be identified  and leases and permits obtained for the proposed use and  impacts. For any staging area that is ultimately used for  construction  of  the  project,  the  Contractor  shall  be  required, as part of contract specifications, to comply with  applicable local zoning laws and other applicable federal,  state,  and  local  rules  and  regulations,  and  to  obtain  necessary permits and approvals.   Staging areas are typically fenced and are often lit for   security.
