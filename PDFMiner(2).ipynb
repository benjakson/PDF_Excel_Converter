coefficient of a element is the ratio of the sound power transmitted through the element per unit area to the sound power incident on the element per unit area loss is the expression of the transmission coefficient on a decibel scale two quantity are related by transmission coefficient of zero mean that none of the incident sound energy passed through the partition i e the transmission loss is infinity great transmission coefficient of one mean that all of the incident sound energy passed through the partition i e the transmission loss is zero of zero applied to an open window or door sound energy passing through each component element of a multi element partition depends on the area and transmission loss of each element equation governing this process is and represent the area and transmission coefficient of the first element for example a wall and represent the area and transmission coefficient of the second element for example a window and represent the area and transmission coefficient of the third element for example a door and represent the area and transmission coefficient of the fourth element for example a ceiling roof assembly and so on quantity and
