## Features

- Conversion of PDF to Excel: The tool takes a PDF file as input and converts it into an Excel file. Each chunk of text in the PDF is divided into separate rows in the Excel sheet for easy organization and analysis.

- Section Identifier: The tool identifies sections in the PDF based on the indentation or level of the text. This allows for logical grouping of content in the resulting Excel sheet, making it easier to understand the document's structure.

- Context Generation: For each piece of text in the PDF, the tool generates context information to provide additional clarity to the requirements management team. This context helps the team better comprehend the content and make informed decisions.

- Scalability: The program has been optimized to work efficiently with over 1000 different PDF files. It can handle a large volume of documents without compromising on speed or accuracy.

- Stylistic Adaptation: The tool adjusts to the stylistic differences found in various PDFs. Whether it's contracts or code, the program can intelligently process and extract relevant information without any loss of data.

## Use Cases

1. **Contract Analysis**: The tool can be used to extract important contractual information from lengthy and complex legal documents. This allows the team to quickly identify crucial obligations and requirements.

2. **Code Requirements Allocation**: For projects involving software development, the tool assists in breaking down the codebase into manageable sections. This helps in allocating requirements and tracking progress more effectively.

3. **Rapid Review and Verification**: The Excel format allows the requirements management team to rapidly review and verify information, significantly reducing manual effort and ensuring accuracy.
